These will be used at runtime to provide a subset of the results normally returned by the data provider selected.
 
- Filter Property:            The attribute type that you may filter this data provider on
- Filter Value:                The values that will apply to the filter property selected
 
These properties will only be enabled for specific data providers for which filter properties have been allowed for. For some data providers, the available filter properties are generated, while others are specifically coded for. (What are the rules behind which data providers have filters and which ones do not?)
E.g.
- Client (specific)
- Matter (specific)
- Employee (specific)
- Office (generated)
 
 
Most filter properties only allow a single item which is either a literal value or a variable. 
> If a VARIABLE value is selected, the filter value applied to the data provider CAN be dynamically updated at runtime. Having selected a filter property that only allows single values, set the Filter Value using by which the data provider will be filtered. This property will accept values, but not expressions.
> If a literal value is selected, the filter value applied to the data provider cannot be dynamically updated at runtime. The same filter value will always apply.

??? PRE-REQUISITE CHECKS ???
- SSRS is pre-requisite???? Should deployment check it is installed before proceeding? Just show a warning??? Not be concerned??
- User specifies SSRS Web Service Url  in environment manifest - Should this be required? NO
 
- Path to SSRS Report server is registered as Reporting Server endpoint - added to clients.config file
- Path set up in SSRS with the name of your environment. Within this folder, there are three folders: Data Sources, DataSets, Reports (these are the default paths that will be used by Expert applications) 
- 'Expert' data source is set up (so you do not need to include in package, will just refer to the one for that environment). Can be used for all Expert data. 
- Default reports imported and installed via packages e.g. Licensing report
- If a path is specified, and the path does not exist --> Fails deployment and rolls back
- If a path is specified, but not available --> Deployment succeeds, no errors or warnings?

- When creating reports, are we going to advise creating reports using the 'Expert' data source as a shared data source, or an embedded data source? (If the data source is specific to the report, should be embedded, otherwise use the shared data source?).

PRE-REQUISITES/SET-UP:
- Create SSRS report - on server 
- Create SSRS report - file available
- Report uses custom (not 'Expert') data source
 
 
-- Before exporting, report data sources and data sets need to be changed to reference the prod database etc (or is it betet
-- Must include custom datasources/datasets in package
--> Items in FWA_PACKAGE_SSRS_ITEM that are assigned to the package being exported are defaulted into SSRS Items grid (ready for export). Looks up /Path table for matching package name and if physical path and file exists, exports file otherwise exports from server
--> Items manually added via 'Add from File' option --> Path defaults to package name but can be changed
--> Items manually added via 'Add from Server' --> Path defaults to same path as on server
--> Add From Server:  Lists ALL items deployed to the SSRS Server (not from our list in database). including reports, shared data sources, and shared data sets
--> Add from Files: Any file on system. Reatrticted to files of type .rdl, .rsd, .rds, ALL
--> On export, items are added to database FWA_PACKAGE_SSRS_ITEM
 
- If a report uses a shared data source or data set, do we need to check/warn whether it also needs to be exported? Or just rely on user's knowledge? Compare adding from server vs add from file
 
 
QUESTIONS:
What happens if:
 - SSRS Web Service Url path not specified in deployment - from file = fine, from server=nothing to export
 - SSRS Web Service Url path specified in deployment is invalid --> should have been caught in Deployment Manager
 - SSRS Reporting not installed/set up - --> should have been caught in Deployment Manager

It is only applicable if the display mode for the duration picker is HH:MM. So assuming display mode is HH:MM, and the the parameter is TRUE, the data entered is treated as decimal, however if the parameter is false, the data entered is treated as HH:MM. If the display mode is decimal, the ''RecogniseDecimals' data entered is ALWAYS treated as decimal.
 
Currently, the 'RecogniseDecimals' parameter can only be maintained in Configuration Manager (there is no other UI to set this):
>Technical > Presentation > Windows > Controls > DurationPicker > RecogniseDecimals (default=true)
 
* Display mode: HH:MM, RecogniseDecimals=True
Data entered by the user is treated as being entered in decimal mode. 
In this case, if a user enters 
     1.5         this equates to 1.5 hours or 1hr 30 m
     1.5         this equates to 1.5 hours or 1hr 30 m
