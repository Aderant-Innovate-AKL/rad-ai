These will be used at runtime to provide a subset of the results normally returned by the data provider selected.
 
- Filter Property:            The attribute type that you may filter this data provider on
- Filter Value:                The values that will apply to the filter property selected
 
These properties will only be enabled for specific data providers for which filter properties have been allowed for. For some data providers, the available filter properties are generated, while others are specifically coded for. (What are the rules behind which data providers have filters and which ones do not?)
E.g.
- Client (specific)
- Matter (specific)
- Employee (specific)
- Office (generated)
 
 
Most filter properties only allow a single item which is either a literal value or a variable. 
> If a VARIABLE value is selected, the filter value applied to the data provider CAN be dynamically updated at runtime. Having selected a filter property that only allows single values, set the Filter Value using by which the data provider will be filtered. This property will accept values, but not expressions.

- SSRS is pre-requisite???? Should deployment check it is installed before proceeding? Just show a warning??? Not be concerned??
- User specifies SSRS Web Service Url  in environment manifest - Should this be required? NO
 
- Path to SSRS Report server is registered as Reporting Server endpoint - added to clients.config file
- Path set up in SSRS with the name of your environment. Within this folder, there are three folders: Data Sources, DataSets, Reports (these are the default paths that will be used by Expert applications) 
- 'Expert' data source is set up (so you do not need to include in package, will just refer to the one for that environment). Can be used for all Expert data. 
- Default reports imported and installed via packages e.g. Licensing report
- If a path is specified, and the path does not exist --> Fails deployment and rolls back
- If a path is specified, but not available --> Deployment succeeds, no errors or warnings?

PRE-REQUISITES/SET-UP:
- Create SSRS report - on server 
- Create SSRS report - file available
- Report uses custom (not 'Expert') data source
 
 
-- Before exporting, report data sources and data sets need to be changed to reference the prod database etc (or is it betet
-- Must include custom datasources/datasets in package
--> Items in FWA_PACKAGE_SSRS_ITEM that are assigned to the package being exported are defaulted into SSRS Items grid (ready for export). Looks up /Path table for matching package name and if physical path and file exists, exports file otherwise exports from server
--> Items manually added via 'Add from File' option --> Path defaults to package name but can be changed
--> Items manually added via 'Add from Server' --> Path defaults to same path as on server
--> Add From Server:  Lists ALL items deployed to the SSRS Server (not from our list in database). including reports, shared data sources, and shared data sets
--> Add from Files: Any file on system. Reatrticted to files of type .rdl, .rsd, .rds, ALL
--> On export, items are added to database FWA_PACKAGE_SSRS_ITEM
 
- If a report uses a shared data source or data set, do we need to check/warn whether it also needs to be exported? Or just rely on user's knowledge? Compare adding from server vs add from file
 
 
QUESTIONS:
What happens if:
 - SSRS Web Service Url path not specified in deployment - from file = fine, from server=nothing to export
 - SSRS Web Service Url path specified in deployment is invalid --> should have been caught in Deployment Manager
 - SSRS Reporting not installed/set up - --> should have been caught in Deployment Manager

It is only applicable if the display mode for the duration picker is HH:MM. So assuming display mode is HH:MM, and the the parameter is TRUE, the data entered is treated as decimal, however if the parameter is false, the data entered is treated as HH:MM.

79937,Custom 1-to-1 table usage - UserData,Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Customization\Domain Customization,2012-12-10T01:33:39.763Z,"This method revolves around using the UserData object which each Domain model object are accompanies with. Both this and the WF variable method allows us to simulate one-to-one mapping between the custom table and linked / FK table. The example below shows how a custom table might be used to capture data from a modified FileOpening workflow.
 
The example below assumes you've created a custom table with two custom columns: Description and Location, both of string type, as well as the mandatory columns required for customization.
Creation of mandatory columns and deploying customization in general is covered in another section.
 
Assuming you've created the custom table and deployed customization, do the following:
 
1. Determine firstly which smartform will have the input that you want to capture. If linked to the client model, you can use any of the smartforms shown along the FileOpening task sequence, and in particular the smartforms such as FileOpening.ClientAdministrative that are encapsulated within FileOpening.ClientSet are good candidates for use.
2. Open Smartform wizard, and edit your chosen smartform; activate the Advanced section by ticking the 'Advanced' box from the Form level smartform properties pane. Entering the script below at the Form level -> Global Declarations:
 
import clr
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Workflow.Activities"")
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Query"")
clr.AddReference(""System"")
clr.AddReference(""WindowsBase"")
from Aderant.Workflow.Activities import WorkflowScript
from System import DateTime
from Aderant.Query.ViewModels import CUSTOMTABLE
 
Then insert the following section in the 'Additional Functions' section
 
def SetClientUserData(self):
    if(self.Data.Client != None and self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLE != None):
        if (self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLE.Count == 0):
            custom = CUSTOMTABLE()
            self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLE.Add(custom)
        self.Data.Client.UserData.Description=self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLE[0].DESCRIPTION
        self.Data.Client.UserData.Location=self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLE[0].LOCATION
 
Where CUSTOMTABLE is the name of your custom table. When the table is imported, it is done so as a collection hence it is pluralized and requires an index when assigning value to its properties.
DESCRIPTION and LOCATION are the two columns I wanted to gather user input from. NOTE this is only the case if you do not assign a unique index on the foreign key column.
UserData.Description and UserData.Location will be created in the steps below. Basically we are accounting for an 'Edit' situation so that we retrieve from the Custom Table properties when displaying information.
 
3. Then in the OnLoaded section, add the following script:
 
self.SetClientUserData()
 
This is so that the custom fields are populated with any existing data we may have in the custom table.After PendingSave phase the client will never change, so we will need to retrieve the persisted data from PendingSave to populate in the forms for the rest of the FileOpening workflow.
 
4. In the On Data Changed section, add the following script:
 
if(dataName == ""Client""):
    self.SetClientUserData()
 
This is so that during Intake phase where the client is picked for the first time, the fields are properly set with existing data (if any), or otherwise create a new empty collection item if there was none.
 
5. Now we need to create UserData items. To do this, open the 'add/edit items' dialogue box, open the Client model, then browse down to Client.UserData. Right click on UserData, and select 'Add Item'
 a. For each field of data you want to capture, add a corresponding item inside UserData.
 b. Repeat until you've created enough fields for capture. Be sure to tick each item to display them on the form.
 
6.For each UserData item added, add the script below to the Scripting->OnChanged section. 
 
self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES[0].DESCRIPTION=self.Data.Client.UserData.Description
 
Where CUSTOMTABLES is your custom table collection name and UserData.Description is your UserData item name.
 
7. Open up the FileOpening workflow in Visual Studio / Design Studio, and find the 'ClientExpand' string variable from the variable list. Modify the end of the string to contain "", CUSTOMTABLES"" where CUSTOMTABLES is the pluralized name of your custom table. This is so the script utilizing the ClientExpand string will know to pull back the data for your custom table during the data retrieval process.
 
 
For reference, below is an earlier approach using UserData which gets around the custom data being wiped after the pending save phase (but the above is the ideal approach)
 
1. Determine firstly which smartform you will enter the input that you want to capture. If linked to the client model, you can use any of the smartforms shown along the FileOpening task sequence, and in particular the smartforms such as FileOpening.ClientAdministrative that are encapsulated within FileOpening.ClientSet are good candidates for use.
2. Now we need to create UserData items. To do this, open the 'add/edit items' dialogue box, open the Client model, then browse down to Client.UserData. Right click on UserData, and select 'Add Item'
 a. For each field of data you want to capture, add a corresponding item inside UserData.
 b. Repeat until you've created enough fields for capture. Be sure to tick each item to display them on the form.
4. Add the script below to a separate script / or embedded inside a dynamic script activity:
 
import clr
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Workflow.Activities"")
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Query"")
clr.AddReference(""System"")
clr.AddReference(""WindowsBase"")
from Aderant.Workflow.Activities import WorkflowScript
from System import DateTime
from Aderant.Query.ViewModels import CUSTOMTABLE
 
class Workflow(WorkflowScript) :
 
    def DynamicScript(self):
        if (self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES.Count == 0):
            custom = CUSTOMTABLE()
            self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES.Add(custom)
        self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES[0].DESCRIPTION=self.Data.Client.UserData.customDescription
        self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES[0].LOCATION=self.Data.Client.UserData.customLocation
 
 
As the custom table is imported as a collection, the object is pluralized and we refer to this when assigning values to the columns. Simply replace the CUSTOMTABLE(S) portion with your own table name.
Also, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION refers to the fields of the custom table - replace them with your own.
 
5. After creating the above script, ensure the script is placed at the first save point inside your workflow. In the case of FileOpening, place this inside the PendingSavePhase, before the PendingSaveSetups activity. The reason for this is that if you had placed the script above inside the SaveSetups.py script, it will be run twice and your custom table will be inserted twice with the same data.

79938,Custom 1-to-1 table usage - WF variables,Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Customization\Domain Customization,2012-12-10T01:33:39.89Z,"This method revolves around using Workflow variables to capture user input. Both this and the User Data method allows us to simulate one-to-one mapping between the custom table and linked / FK table
 
To do this:
 
1. Create the workflow variables for the data you want to capture, preferably named the same as the columns in the custom table that you will be populating against. In this case, I've created customDescription and customLocation
2. Create a new smartform formed solely of the workflow variables you've created.Add this smartform to a task activity, or modify an existing smartform. I recommend adding this at the beginning i.e. IntakeForm. Remember to start smartform wizard from within Visual Studio for WF variables to be visible in smartform wizard. Remember to also refresh the smartform(s) modified so the data contracts are refreshed.
 
**Updated section*************
 
Each of the composite activities are isolated and so we need to create arguments to take in and pass on the workflow variables throughout the workflow. So for each composite activity you will need to define arguments (in our case, customDescription and customLocation). These arguments must be set to In/Out if the workflow variable must be passed back from the Composite Activity to the workflow.
 
Then, for each smartform activity that uses the modified smartform (if you take this approach), you will need to refresh the smartforms so the contracts are updated. You'll need to then assign the workflow variable/arguments to the custom fields you've added to the smartform.
 
After this, you will need to rebuild the solution so the composite activities display the newly added arguments in the property grid.
 
After rebuilding the solution, you will need to assign the workflow variable to the composite activity arguments so that the workflow variable is properly passed in and out of the composite activities.
 
**End of Updated section*************
 
 
3. Add the script below to a separate script / or embedded inside a dynamic script activity:
 
import clr
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Workflow.Activities"")
clr.AddReference(""Aderant.Query"")
clr.AddReference(""System"")
clr.AddReference(""WindowsBase"")
from Aderant.Workflow.Activities import WorkflowScript
from System import DateTime
from Aderant.Query.ViewModels import CUSTOMTABLE
 
class Workflow(WorkflowScript) :
 
    def DynamicScript(self):
        if (self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES.Count == 0):
            custom = CUSTOMTABLE()
            self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES.Add(custom)
        self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES[0].DESCRIPTION=self.Data.customDescription
        self.Data.Client.CUSTOMTABLES[0].LOCATION=self.Data.customLocation
 
 
As the custom table is imported as a collection, the object is pluralized and we refer to this when assigning values to the columns. Simply replace the CUSTOMTABLE(S) portion with your own table name.
Also, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION refers to the fields of the custom table - replace them with your own.
 
4. After creating the above script, ensure the script is placed at the first save point inside your workflow. In the case of FileOpening, place this inside the PendingSavePhase, before the PendingSaveSetups activity. The reason for this is that if you had placed the script above inside the SaveSetups.py script, it will be run twice and your custom table will be inserted twice with the same data.
 
5. Open up the FileOpening workflow in Visual Studio / Design Studio, and find the 'ClientExpand' string variable from the variable list. Modify the end of the string to contain "", CUSTOMTABLES"" where CUSTOMTABLES is the pluralized name of your custom table. This is so the script utilizing the ClientExpand string will know to pull back the data for your custom table during the data retrieval process.
 
6. You should now be able to run and save data to your custom table successfully within a FileOpening workflow!",

Test that each of the above can be customized and consumed successfully
 
NOTE:
When adding new columns via DBEditor, remember to set the 'Nulls' checkbox accordingly. If the field is not a key (Primary or Foreign), then the convention for the Expert database is to allow nulls, and thereby the database columns do not always appear the same in SQL manager as they do via the data dictionary. So a non-key column that you set to NOT allow nulls, will appear this way in the data dictinoary, but in SQL, will appear as nullable.
When the view models are customised to include custom columns, the model is updated according to the data dictionary. If a new columns does NOT allow nulls, you may need to update workflow etc to accomodate otherwise you may get caught out by query service etc if it expects fields etc to be non-nullable.
 
 
Note: RE: 'Text' data type
Technically it is still supported, but should be viewed as deprecated functionality which will be removed at some point.
The majority of long character based columns within the Expert data dictionary will be defined as a STRING(LONG) which maps to sql as a VARCHAR(MAX) in 75SP3HF01 and to TEXT for pre-hf01 sites. 
LONGTEXT is mapped directly to the TEXT data type, but is rarely used. 
 
Text and varchar(max) are viewed as compatible types within the DD post 75SP3HF01. 
All new development should use STRING(LONG) where long character based columns are needed.",

In the matter search, it is now possible to search for a matter by entering its client and matter details with a '.' in between.
E.g.
ClientCode.MatterCode
ClientName.MatterName
ClientCode.MatterName
ClientName.MatterCode
 
Notes for concatenation search: 
(a) You can enter partial names/codes. e.g. 109.1 will find Client with code 10901 and matter code 1000
(b) If there are '.'s in Client Names or Matter Names, we basically take the last '.' entered in the search criteria as the separator between the client criteria and matter criteria on the presumption that periods are more common in client names than matter descriptions. 
E.g. K.Mitthal Inc.1000 è client criteria = ""K.Mitthal Inc"", matter criteria = ""1000""

To make this change we need to create the following entry (it does not exist by default) ""Technical.Presentation.Windows.RequiredDecoratorColor"" and set it to a valid XAML colour value. If no entry is found then the color will be set to ORANGE by default.
We have a list of hard coded colors such as Green, Blue, Red etc.
We also allow hex values such as #FFF8AB69 (Green)
 
Requirements
IMPORTANT: Close all running instances of EA and other product apps before each step !!
The changes we make will not take into effect until we start a new instances of the apps.
Also have a FO workflow with intake task (1st task) ready in EA task inbox.
 
To Test:
1. Add ""Technical.Presentation.Windows.RequiredDecoratorColor"" in Configuration Manager and give it a value of ""Red"" and leave it as a type of text, then save.
        open EA and Rates app.
        in EA, open the intake task and check that the required fields are highlighed as Red
        in Rates, click on New -> Timekeeper Rate on the ribbon and check that the required fields are highlight is Red
        close EA and Rates
 
2. Go back to CM and change the value to ""#FFF8AB69"" (This is the hex value for color green)
        open EA and Rates app.
        in EA, open the intake task and check that the required fields are highlighed as Green
        in Rates, click on New -> Timekeeper Rate on the ribbon and check that the required fields are highlight as Green
        close EA and Rates
 
2. Go back to CM and Delete the configure value we added
        open EA and Rates app.
        in EA, open the intake task and check that the required fields are highlighed as Orange (default color)
        in Rates, click on New -> Timekeeper Rate on the ribbon and check that the required fields are highlight as Orange (default color)","Step 1: Add ""Technical.Presentation.Windows.RequiredDecoratorColor"" in Configuration Manager and give it a value of ""Red"" and leave it as a type of text, then save. After that open EA and Rates app.
**REMEMBER to close EA and Rates after each step** | Expected: i) in EA, open the intake task and check that the required fields are highlighed as RED
ii) in Rates, click on New -> Timekeeper Rate on the ribbon and check that the required fields are highlight as RED || Step 2: Change the configure value to GREEN (Hex)Go back to CM and change the value to ""#FFF8AB69"" (This is the hex value for color green) then open EA and Rates app. (Bug 83873: SP2, this step fails but there will be no fix as this is as designed for now) | Expected: i) in EA, open the intake task and check that the required fields are highlighed as GREEN
ii) in Rates, click on New -> Timekeeper Rate on the ribbon and check that the required fields are highlight as GREEN || Step 3: Delete the entry and restore to default

This is currently only enabled for Client/Matter/Employee data providers. You are no longer required to select Deep Search in order to initiate it. The default behaviour is to do a deep search but this is executed immediately after the non-deep search (without user intervention). Only the first 100 results are returned, however if you press Browse All, the remaining results are also displayed. 
 
·       New search feature ""Deep Search"" allows searches to distinguish between a quick search and one that is more detailed. Data providers and stored procedures must be updated to add this capability. For now, only the Client, Matter, and Employee searches will have this capability. Where ""Deep Search"" is available, it will replace the ""Browse All"" link that is displayed in the search .
·       ""Browse All"" (or ""Deep Search""  if the data provider caters for this) is ALWAYS available 
·       ""Browse All"" and ""Deep Search"" ALWAYS clears cache
·       ""Browse All"" or ""Deep Search"" may be pressed before the delay is complete (i.e. before auto-search commences)
·       If ""Deep Search"" is not enabled and ""Browse All"" is clicked, the search is no different from the initial search except that it returns the full list of results if there is more than 100
·       If ""Deep Search"" is enabled and it is clicked, a more detailed search (according to stored proc) is performed. The result set is limited to the maximum set by the stored procedure
- A few key differences between non-deep search, and deep search:
         (a) Non-deep does a ""starts with"" search on the beginning of the string/field it is searching (not the beginning of each word in that string
               Deep search does a ""contain"" search on EACH word in the string
         (b) FTI
               Non-deep search does NOT do an FTI search 
               Deep search DOES do an FTI search

User enters more digits after the decimal symbol than the control has been set up to allow --> Entry of value is not prevented, however a validation error appears

When focus is set in a numeric control that has a value with deimcal places, the control only displays the characters that were entered by the user, not any padding that was displayed when the control was not in focus

2. Breaks in tab order will be done manually using a divider, new form…
3. ""Blanks"" can be inserted into a ""cell"" and will be skipped over by User tab ('Empty Cell 'control).
4. Spanning goes left to right.That means that, in a 2 column layout, only items in the 1st column can be spanned.If an item in the second column has been set to span, the span will be ignored.This rule will be outlined in the instructions and possibly in the wizard interface using validation feedback or instructional text.

Add data to grid cell
- For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker test that you can add/or select a value to the cell, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
- For Search Control cells, you can use the up and down arrow keys, then hit 'enter' to select a value. If the cell is in 'display' mode you need to hit 'enter' first to change to 'edit' mode. Then hit 'enter' again to change back to 'display' mode.
 
Delete data from grid cell
- For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker test that you can delete a value from the cell, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
- You can delete cell data by hitting 'enter' key to change to 'edit mode'. Then using the backspace key, or clicking on the cell's 'x' delete button.
- You can also delete the cell data by hitting the 'escape' key twice.
 
Edit grid cell value
For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker, test that you can edit an existing cell value, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
 
Validation Errors
If the cell has a validation error, the Validation Error icon should be displayed to the right of the cell control (within the cell). 
Test that:
1. Validation Error! Message you get when you hover over the Validation Error icon is correct.
2. Validation icon disappears when you edit the cell to a valid value, and 'x' delete cell data re-appears.
3. Cells that are required fields should have the control border highlighted orange until valid data is entered/selected. If the user tries to click on the '+' add new row button there should be a dialog that alerts the user that a required item is either missing or invalid.
 
Change order of grid column
You can change the order of the grid columns by clicking on the grid column title cell and dragging to the required location (i.e. before or after another column).
 
Sort grid columns
You can sort grid columns by clicking on the grid column title cell.
 
Save Grid Data
Grid data is saved when you enter data then hit 'enter' key, or when you click '+' button at end of row.
SAVING CELL DATA - Test for cells which are different control types e.g. DatePicker, Search control, textbox.
When you hit the 'enter' key after entering/selecting data in a cell, this changes the cell mode from 'edit' to 'display' and saves the data from that cell. The cell data should still be displayed after you have hit 'enter'..
SAVING ROW DATA
The row of data is saved when you click on the '+' button at the end of the row. This button also adds a new row to the top of the grid. The row you saved is no longer the insertion row, and the row mode has changed from 'edit' to 'display' mode. 
VALIDATION ERRORS
If one of the cells in the row has a validation error, the cell data will still be saved when you lose focus on the cell.
 
Create new row of data in grid
-Check that can enter data into insertion row (which is always at the top) and has pencil icon to show row is in 'edit mode'.
-Test that you can't add a new (insertion) row if the current insertion row is blank. I.e. there shouldn't be a whole lot of blank rows in your grid.
-Check that you can't create a new (insertion) row if your previous rows contain validation errors. If so, then check that you can create a new (insertion) row if you have fixed the validation errors on the previous (insertion) row.
 
SAVING CELL DATA - Test for cells which are different control types e.g. DatePicker, Search control, textbox.
When you hit the 'enter' key after entering/selecting data in a cell, this changes the cell mode from 'edit' to 'display' and saves the data from that cell. The cell data should still be displayed after you have hit 'enter'..
 
SAVING ROW DATA
The row of data is saved when you click on the '+' button at the end of the row. This button also adds a new row to the top of the grid. The row you saved is no longer the insertion row, and the row mode has changed from 'edit' to 'display' mode. 
 
VALIDATION ERRORS
If one of the cells in the row has a validation error, the cell data will still be saved when you lose focus on the cell.
 
Delete grid row
Test that you can delete the row by clicking on any cell within that row and clicking on the 'x' remove button at the end of the row, or using the 'Remove' button (at the top right hand side).
 
Navigate across grid row
Test you can use the tab and shift+tab keys to move back and forth across a grid row.
 
Navigate between grid rows
- Test that you can navigate between grid rows using the up and down keyboard arrows, and by clicking on different rows using the mouse.
- Use ESCAPE key to take focus from indiviudal cell to navigate between rows
 
Select grid row
- To select a row click on any cell within that row.
- To select more than one row - use shift + click on the rows, and either use the up/down arrows or the mouse to select the rows.",

In Visual Studio, create a new custom controller (if you make changes to the generated controller, these will be overwritten and lost when the controller is re-generated each time the SF is saved)
1. Add a class to a project that will overwrite the base controller scripts for any custom scripting required
              a. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the .smartform file and select ""Add custom smartform logic""
2. Add custom scripting to overwrite the default behaviour
              a. Open the generated controller file AND the custom controller file
              b. In the GENERATED controller file, copy the namespace at the top of the file, then in the CUSTOM controller, replace the existing namespace with the one copied from the generated file
              c. In the GENERATED controller file, copy the public partial class name from the top of the script to the custom controller
                  e.g. Generated controller had
                           public partial class BaseSmartFormController : BaseSmartFormControllerBase {
                               private static readonly ILogWriter logWriter = Logger.Current.GetLogWriter();
                  Into the Custom controller, enter:
                            public partial class BaseSmartFormController
              d. In the custom controller, create partial class methods to overwrite the base logic in the generated controller. Example below is what would replace what was previously stored in SFW scripting points which would then have been generated into an IronPython controller: 
 
Form level:                 OnLoaded = self.LogWriter.Log(LogLevel.Error, 'OnLoaded script for Advanced SmartForm')
                                  OnValidate = self.LogWriter.Log(LogLevel.Error, 'OnValidate script for Advanced SmartForm')
                                  OnDataChanged=self.LogWriter.Log(LogLevel.Error, 'OnDataChanged script for Advanced SmartForm')
 
Control level:              OnChange=self.LogWriter.Log(LogLevel.Error, 'Client has changed')

Expected UI behaviours in SmartForm grids
 
Add data to grid cell
- For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker test that you can add/or select a value to the cell, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
- For Search Control cells, you can use the up and down arrow keys, then hit 'enter' to select a value. If the cell is in 'display' mode you need to hit 'enter' first to change to 'edit' mode. Then hit 'enter' again to change back to 'display' mode.
 
Delete data from grid cell
- For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker test that you can delete a value from the cell, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
- You can delete cell data by hitting 'enter' key to change to 'edit mode'.  Then using the backspace key, or clicking on the cell's 'x' delete button.
- You can also delete the cell data by hitting the 'escape' key twice.
 
Edit grid cell value
For each of the grid cell control types - Textbox, search control and Date Picker, test that you can edit an existing cell value, whether the cell is on the insertion row or an existing (posted/saved) row.
 
Validation Errors
If the cell has a validation error, the Validation Error icon should be displayed to the right of the cell control (within the cell). 
Test that:
1. Validation Error! Message you get when you hover over the Validation Error icon is correct.
2. Validation icon disappears when you edit the cell to a valid value, and 'x' delete cell data re-appears.
3. Cells that are required fields should have the control border highlighted orange until valid data is entered/selected. If the user tries to click on the '+' add new row button there should be a dialog that alerts the user that a required item is either missing or invalid.
 
Change order of grid column
You can change the order of the grid columns by clicking on the grid column title cell and dragging to the required location (i.e. before or after another column).
 
Sort grid columns
You can sort grid columns by clicking on the grid column title cell.
 
Save Grid Data
Grid data is saved when you enter data then hit 'enter' key, or when you click '+' button at end of row.
SAVING CELL DATA - Test for cells which are different control types e.g. DatePicker, Search control, textbox.
When you hit the 'enter' key after entering/selecting data in a cell, this changes the cell mode from 'edit' to 'display' and saves the data from that cell. The cell data should still be displayed after you have hit 'enter'..
SAVING ROW DATA
The row of data is saved when you click on the  '+' button at the end of the row. This button also adds a new row to the top of the grid. The row you saved is no longer the insertion row, and the row mode has changed from 'edit' to 'display' mode.  
VALIDATION ERRORS
If one of the cells in the row has a validation error, the cell data will still be saved when you lose focus on the cell.
 
Create new row of data in grid
-Check that can enter data into insertion row (which is always at the top) and has pencil icon to show row is in 'edit mode'.
-Test that you can't add a new (insertion) row if the current insertion row is blank. I.e. there shouldn't be a whole lot of blank rows in your grid.
-Check that you can't create a new (insertion) row if your previous rows contain validation errors. If so, then check that you can create a new (insertion) row if you have fixed the validation errors on the previous (insertion) row.
 
SAVING CELL DATA - Test for cells which are different control types e.g. DatePicker, Search control, textbox.
When you hit the 'enter' key after entering/selecting data in a cell, this changes the cell mode from 'edit' to 'display' and saves the data from that cell. The cell data should still be displayed after you have hit 'enter'..
 
SAVING ROW DATA
The row of data is saved when you click on the  '+' button at the end of the row. This button also adds a new row to the top of the grid. The row you saved is no longer the insertion row, and the row mode has changed from 'edit' to 'display' mode.

   (a) If Percentage Responded < Amount --> workflow should wait for futher replicated tasks to be completed before re-evalutating
   (b) If Percentage Responded = Amount --> workflow should cancel any incomplete replicated tasks and move on

Basic end-to-end smoke test for the Query activity
 
1. Create a workflow variable called ""FrankfurtClients"". The type should be ViewModelObservableCollection<Client>
2. Create another workflow variable called ""FrankfurtClientsList"" of type String
3. Drag Query activity onto workflow 
4. Set the Source to 'Clients'
5. Set the where clause to: item.OfficeId=""FRAN""
6. Set Result to variable: FrankfurtClients
7. Add an Assign activity
        a. On the LHS, set variable: FrankfurtClientList
        b. On the RHS, set: String.Join("", "", From client In FrankfurtClients Select client.DisplayName)
8. Add an approval task activity to workflow 
        a. Attach a decsion.text SmartForm. Change the text to 
              ""Frankfurt clients are: "" & FrankfurtClientList
        b. Set the task performer to workflow.initiator

---------------------------------
If a grouped notification is received, the user may click on the 'X' to close it. If they do so, they should not receive ANY further task notifications in the next 30 seconds. These are just never received. Any notifications received AFTER 30 seconds, will be displayed, and will resume usual behavior.
 
Things to Test:
1. Launch two Visual Studio, and open two different workflow

3. When the grouped task notification appears, click on the 'x' before it reaches a count of 20

Test Objective: Verify the correct functionality of the email notification setting as a reminder when tasks are assigned to a user and are not complete in 'x' number of days.
 
Scenario Traceability: http://tfs.ap.aderant.com:8080/WorkItemTracking/WorkItem.aspx?artifactMoniker=16519
 
In Expert Assistant:
EA Setting> Task Inbox> Reminder email
EA Setting> Task Inbox> Reminder Days Elapsed
 
Details:
Users should be able to set a notification to self thru email about tasks not yet completed within a specified amount of time.  In the ExpertAssistant settings, this notification can be set to true or false.  If true, the number of days after a task is assigned (accepted, shared or unaccepted) is set in the EA settings.  Also, it should be able to allow the user to set it to either a repeatable or a non-repeatable notification.  Repeatable notifications simply sends email reminders everyday (defaults to 12.00am), regardless of the number of days set for the initial reminder.  A flow that allows the assigned, shared and escalated tasks (both to one user and multiple users) should be used to test this.
 
Pre-requisite:
1.  Reminder should be ticked or set to true.  In EA, go to Settings then Task Inbox.  Set the reminder to true (tick the box).  Enter a number in the ""Reminder Days Elapse"" other than zero.
2.  Make sure that CMS partner database has your email address (locate your record in HBM_PERSNL table and verify existence of email address).  Manually updating FWM_USER is not viable since partner databases synch everyday.
3.  In config, make sure the FromEmail field is not blank and does not have your email address (same from and to email addresses are treated as spam).  Located here ==> Technical.Framework.Workflow
4.  For testing purposes, reminder can be set to minutes or hours rather than days as configuration manager accepts values in seconds.  See config values here ==> Technical.Framework.Worklfow.Management
 
 
Functional test:
A. Assigned to one or more users
Verify that email will be sent as a reminder for all active tasks (accepted, unaccepted and reassigned) in the task inbox according to the reminder settings.   Verify that the notification will be sent again daily when it is set to repeatable.
 
B. Shared to multiple users
Verify that email will be sent as a reminder for all active shared tasks in the task inbox according to the reminder settings.   Verify that the notification will be sent again daily when it is set to repeatable.
 
C. Delegated to one or more users
Verify that email will be sent as a reminder for all active delegated tasks in the task inbox according to the reminder settings.   Verify that the notification will be sent again daily when it is set to repeatable.",

==============================================
 
Creating Single Activity
 
Before You Begin
You must have set up your Customization environment to enable you to create custom workflow activities. 
You will also need to have created the workflow project (.csproj) that you want to add the custom activity to. 
 
Instructions
To add a single custom activity to a workflow project:
1. Launch Visual Studio 2010. The Visual Studio 2010 startup screen displays.
2. In the ADERANT toolbar, click [Open project]. The Open Project screen displays.
3. Specify the location of the workflow project (.csproj) that you want to add the activity to.
4. Click Open.
5. Select Project > Add New Item from the main menu. The Add New Item screen displays.
6. In the Installed Templates pane to the left of the screen, select Visual C# > Workflow.
7. In the middle pane, select Activity.
8. Click Add. A new blank custom activity is added to the project and the designer for this activity opens.
9. In the Simplified Explorer pane, select <ActivityName>.xaml.
10. Build the activity to meet your requirements.
    Tip: Building a new activity is an advanced customization scenario which involves writing C# code called a Code Activity (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd489425.aspx).
11. Click [save].
12. Select Build > Build Solution from the main menu
 
What Happens Next
The new activity is displayed in the Toolbox pane to the left of the screen and is available to use within the workflow project.
 
You can now choose to do one or more of the following actions:
1.  To add the new activity to the current workflow:  
               Drag the activity from the Toolbox pane to the left of the screen on to the editing pane. 
2.  To add the new activity to another workflow within the current solution:  
               Drag the activity from the Toolbox pane to the left of the screen on to the editing pane. 
3.  To add the new activity to another workflow solution: 
               Add a reference in the workflow project to the output (.dll) file of the custom activity library.
4.  To make the new activity available to workflow projects and solutions in another environment:   
               Add a reference in the workflow project to the output (.dll) file of the custom activity library. 
 
Note: To add created activities:
1. Right-click in the toolbox and 'Add a Tab'.  
2. In that Tab, right-click and 'Choose Items'.  
3. In the 'Choose Toolbox Items' select the 'System.Activities Components' tab.
4. Click 'Browse' and locate the project folder where the activities were created.
5. Select the .dll in the Bin folder and click 'Open'.  If the 'System.Activities Components' grid is sorted according to Directory, notice that all the .xaml files (includes any workflow file), which are effectively the created activities, are selected (ticked).
6. Tick/untick the activities.",

Need to include all possible activities into the library to see if there are dependency issues e.g. dynamic Script activity depending on the existance of AppData to find its workflow.py file and actually work.
 
======================================
 
Creating Activity Libraries
 
Before You Begin
You must have set up your Customization environment to enable you to create custom workflow activities. 
You will also need to have created the workflow project (.csproj) that you want to add the custom activity to. 
 
Instructions to create a custom activity:
1. Launch Visual Studio 2010). The main Workflow Designer screen displays.
2. In the ADERANT toolbar, click [Open project] . The Open Project screen displays.
3. Specify the location of the workflow project (.csproj) that you want to add the custom activity to.
Note: If you already have a workflow solution (.sln) open, you can choose to either open this workflow project within that solution (by selecting the Add to Solution option) or close the current solution and open the one that contains the workflow project (by selecting the Close Solution option).
4. Click Open.
     Tip: The Open button provides a dropdown with a Show previous versions option.
5. Select File > Add > New Project from the main menu. The Add New Project screen displays.
6. In the Installed Templates pane to the left of the screen, select Visual C# > Expert. A list of ADERANT Expert templates is displayed in the middle pane.
7. In the middle pane, select Expert Workflow Activity Library.
     Tip: We strongly recommend that you use the ADERANT Expert template because it already has all the references required for the ADERANT Expert environment set up.
8. Click OK. An activity library (and activity.xaml file) is added to the project. the new activity library is listed in the Simplified Explorer pane to the right of the screen.
9. In the Simplified Explorer pane to the right of the screen, select the ActivityName.xaml file.
     Tip: If the Simplified Explorer pane is not visible, select the Simplified Layout button from the ADERANT toolbar.
10. Build the activity to meet your requirements.
     Tip: Building a new activity library is an advanced customization scenario which involves writing C# code called a Code Activity (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/dd489425.aspx).
11. Click [Save].
12. Select Build > Build Solution from the main menu.
 
Add New Activity to Workflow
To add the newly created activity to one of the workflow projects in the solution that is currently open:
1. In the Simplified Explorer view to the right of the screen, double-click the workflow.xamlx file associated with the workflow project that you want to add the activity to. That file should be loaded, or become active, within the editing pane in the middle of the screen.
2. Drag new activity from the Toolbox pane to the right of the screen, into the editing pane in the middle of the screen.
3. In the Properties pane to the right of the screen, complete the properties for the new activity.
     Tip: If the Properties pane is not displayed, select View > Properties Window from the main menu.
4. Click in the Aderant Toolbar. The workflow.xmalx file is saved.
 
What Happens Next
The new activity is displayed in the Toolbox pane to the left of the screen and is available to use within any of the workflow projects within the current workflow solution.
     Tip: If the Toolbox pane is not displayed to the left of the screen, select View > Toolbox from the main menu.
 
You can now choose to do one or more of the following actions:
1.  To make this activity library available to workflow projects and solutions in another environment:
               Copy the output (dll) file and add it as a reference in the target project.
 
2.  To add another activity to the activity library:
               a. Right-click on the Activity Library and select Add New Item. The Add File screen displays.
               b. Select Visual C# > Workflow.
               c. Select Activity.
               d. In the Name: field, specify a name for the new activity.
               e. Click OK. The new activity is listed under the Activity Library.
               f. In the Simplified Explorer, select the ActivityName.xmal file.
               g. Build the new activity, as required.
               h. Click [Save] in the Aderant Toolbar. The new activity is saved.
               i. Select Build > Build Solution from the main menu. The new activity is added to the Toolbox pane to the left of the screen and will be available to use within any of the workflow projects within the current workflow solution.
 
3.  To make this activity library available to workflows outside of the current workflow solution but within the current environment:
               Copy the output (dll) file and add it as a reference in the target project.
 
4.  To make this activity library available to workflow projects and solutions in another environment:

Selecting Yes will adjust all other tasks by the number of days the current task has preceded expectation.
 
- If a user completes a task AFTER the Due Date, then they are given a dialog that states ""You have completed this task behind schedule, do you wish to defer all other active tasks accordingly?"" Selecting Yes will adjust all other tasks by the number of days the current task has been late.
 
SECURITY:
 
Processes and Task reschedule options are new securable operations for workflow. 
Default Workflow Admin policy and default Workflow Supervisor policy should include both of these rights - Reschedule at Task and Process level. 
Default Perform policy should include the reschedule task right only - Reschedule at Task level only.",

Some examples below from the follpwing website:
http://www.csharp-examples.net/string-format-datetime/
 
String Format for DateTime [C#]
This example shows how to format DateTime using String.Format method. All formatting can be done also using DateTime.ToString method.
Custom DateTime Formatting
There are following custom format specifiers y (year), M (month), d (day), h (hour 12), H (hour 24), m (minute), s (second), f (second fraction), F (second fraction, trailing zeroes are trimmed), t (P.M or A.M) and z (time zone).
Following examples demonstrate how are the format specifiers rewritten to the output.
[C#]// create date time 2008-03-09 16:05:07.123
DateTime dt = new DateTime(2008, 3, 9, 16, 5, 7, 123);

String.Format(""{0:y yy yyy yyyy}"", dt);  // ""8 08 008 2008""   year
String.Format(""{0:M MM MMM MMMM}"", dt);  // ""3 03 Mar March""  month
String.Format(""{0:d dd ddd dddd}"", dt);  // ""9 09 Sun Sunday"" day
String.Format(""{0:h hh H HH}"",     dt);  // ""4 04 16 16""      hour 12/24
String.Format(""{0:m mm}"",          dt);  // ""5 05""            minute
String.Format(""{0:s ss}"",          dt);  // ""7 07""            second
String.Format(""{0:f ff fff ffff}"", dt);  // ""1 12 123 1230""   sec.fraction
String.Format(""{0:F FF FFF FFFF}"", dt);  // ""1 12 123 123""    without zeroes
String.Format(""{0:t tt}"",          dt);  // ""P PM""            A.M. or P.M.
String.Format(""{0:z zz zzz}"",      dt);  // ""-6 -06 -06:00""   time zone


You can use also date separator / (slash) and time sepatator : (colon). These characters will be rewritten to characters defined in the current DateTimeForma­tInfo.DateSepa­rator and DateTimeForma­tInfo.TimeSepa­rator.
[C#]// date separator in german culture is ""."" (so ""/"" changes to ""."")
String.Format(""{0:d/M/yyyy HH:mm:ss}"", dt); // ""9/3/2008 16:05:07"" - english (en-US)
String.Format(""{0:d/M/yyyy HH:mm:ss}"", dt); // ""9.3.2008 16:05:07"" - german (de-DE)


Here are some examples of custom date and time formatting:
[C#]// month/day numbers without/with leading zeroes
String.Format(""{0:M/d/yyyy}"", dt);            // ""3/9/2008""
String.Format(""{0:MM/dd/yyyy}"", dt);          // ""03/09/2008""

// day/month names
String.Format(""{0:ddd, MMM d, yyyy}"", dt);    // ""Sun, Mar 9, 2008""
String.Format(""{0:dddd, MMMM d, yyyy}"", dt);  // ""Sunday, March 9, 2008""

// two/four digit year
String.Format(""{0:MM/dd/yy}"", dt);            // ""03/09/08""
String.Format(""{0:MM/dd/yyyy}"", dt);          // ""03/09/2008""


Standard DateTime Formatting
In DateTimeForma­tInfo there are defined standard patterns for the current culture. For example property ShortTimePattern is string that contains value h:mm tt for en-US culture and value HH:mm for de-DE culture.
Following table shows patterns defined in DateTimeForma­tInfo and their values for en-US culture. First column contains format specifiers for the String.Format method.

100295,User is able to create a variable for attachments rather than use a fixed string,Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow\Activities,2014-04-08T01:37:24.13Z,"In Visual Studio, the user should be able to create a workflow and create a variable (e.g. AttachmentPath) to enable the ability to add a file path later on in the workflow, rather than having to hardcode it as a string when designing the workflow.
 
In Visual Studio, create a workflow with an email task and a system note task.
Create a string variable in the workflow (e.g. AttachmentPath) and add this to the attachment field in the properties of each of these tasks.
 
This should allow the user to later on add the fie path for the attachment, when the user used to have to add the file path as a string in this field.
 
In the workflow attached, we have also included an approval task to allow the user to enter the file path. 
Within this field, we need to test three different types of paths
- File paths (e.g. C:\Temp\... )
- Network file paths (e.g. \\svnas301\tempswap... )
- Expressions (e.g. String.Format(""C:\Temp\{0}"", ""..."") )
 
To test that the variable works, we need to check that in both the email received and the system note attached to the workflow, the specified file is attached. 
The workflow may need to be run 3 times in order to test all three of these types of file paths - try to use different attachments for each type so we can ensure the workflow doesn't hold on to the first file attached.",

100379,User is able to send emails (allocate tasks) to workgroups,Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow\Activities\Send Email,2014-04-08T21:53:20.87Z,"To test this, you will need to set up a workgroup which includes a number of people whose email you can monitor to ensure all members of the workgroup get the email.
To set up a workgroup:
In Appshell: Hub Setup > Personnel Setup > Select a workgroup (e.g. PM), hit attach on the bottom left and assign people to the workgroup.
In SQL, you can check the different IDs and properties of the workgroup by selecting the top 1000 rows of the HBL_WORKGROUP table (right-click, ""select top 1000 rows).
 
You will need to import the attached workflow, and open it in Visual Studio. In the ""send email"" task, change the TO: field to one or some of the properties of the workgroup or an individual (to make sure the send email activity works as normal as well as being able to send to work groups - these properties are listed below)
 
Username (e.g. Firstname.Lastname)
UserId 
User Uno
User email address
Group Name (e.g. PM)
Group ID
Group Uno
Group Display Name (e.g. Practice Management)
 
When you run the workflow, it will send you an approval task to attach a file path - attach a path (such as ""C:\temp\..."") and when you ""approve"", an email should be sent to ALL members in the group (if you use any properties of the workgroup) or only to the user you specified. Make sure that all users also get the attachment (if nobody does, it's possible the path is wrong)",

125802,Design Studio - Share Rules 01 - Add an Existing Rule to Another Rule Point,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Applications\Design Studio\Rules,2015-11-18T03:14:51.82Z,"This Test Covers:
The ability to select an existing rule to use at another rule point
- Select Existing right-click function
- Toggle the ""Only show compatible items"" option
- Use the search function at the top of the dialog
 
Background:
We now have the ability to share one rule between several extension points that have compatible data contracts with the rule. You're able to create a rule under one extension point and then select that rule from another extension point so it can be used in both places. 


 
To check which data contracts are in a particular Extension Point, right-click on the Extension Point and click ""Properties"". This will bring you to a new tab where you can see what contracts are available. With regards to selecting an existing rule for this extension point, this just means that if you're using the Prebill Edit Disbursement Validation extension point, then you won't be able to select a rule with a condition of ""Time.BaseHours > 1"" as the ""Time"" contract is not in the list/available for this Extension Point. 

 
The rule can be edited under any of the extension points it is ""shared"" with and it will change for all - visually, it looks like there is just a rule with the same name under each extension point, but update one and they all update, rather than if you duplicated the rule and only the version you update gets updated.
 
With regards to the rule's contracts, a contract from the Extension Point will only be considered ""on"" the rule if the rule actually uses it. For example, if the rule is under Extension Points A (with Client contract) and B (with Client and Matter contracts), it will not have ""Client"" and ""Matter"" contracts unless the rule uses them (speaking in terms of what the compatibility checks check against). 
With regards to what is available to the rule in this scenario, it will depend on where the rule is opened from - if the rule is opened from under Extension Point A, only Client will be available to use. If it is opened from under Extension Point B, Client and Matter will be available.
When editing and saving a rule, a validation check will occur to determine whether the rule is still compatible with the other Extension Points it is shared with. For example, if the rule is opened under Extension Point B and the rule is changed to use the Matter contract, then a dialog will pop up when you try to save the rule which will notify you that the rule is no longer compatible with Extension Point A. From here, you have two options - remove the reference to the incompatible Extension Point, or cancel the save and change the rule so it remains compatible.
Note: Local Variables/Contracts should not affect the matching between Rules and Extension Points on both the select existing function and when saving.
 
When it comes to different versions of rules, the compatibility check will be additive - that means if you edit a rule as a new version and remove the use of Client (for example), the check that occurs when saving will still check for Client compatibility - Client will still be a part of the rule's contracts.
--> Different versions are created when you edit a rule on a different day you created it (24 hours after creation)
 
 
 
Note: there is a Usages tab which will show all the extension points/areas where the rule is used - there will be another test case for this, however.

Right-click and ""Add Rule"" > ""Create New"" || Step 3: Enter a name for your rule and enter in a message (e.g. ""Please Try Again"" (with quotes)) || Step 4: Tick Conditional and add a condition specifc to the extension point (for example, if you're using one of the Time extension points, use ""Time.BaseHours > 1"" - this will be used as a check later) || Step 5: Save the rule and close the tab || Step 6: Right-click on another Extension Point under the same area that has the same/compatible data contracts that were used in your rule (e.g. Prebill Processing Time Validation). ""Add Rule"" > ""Select Existing""Note: To check if the data contracts are compatible, right-click and ""Properties"" on the Extension Point. The Extension Point must contain the contract you used in your rule (in the example, that would be ""Time""). | Expected: A window will pop up showing the available rules to select. The rules listed will have similar/compatible data contracts as the extension point you are adding a rule to (for example, most likely Expenses rules will not use the same data contracts as Billing rules).By default, ""Only show items with compatible data contract and return types"" is ticked || Step 7: Toggle the ""Only show items with compatible data contract and return types"" option on and off | Expected: With the option set to true, only rules that are compatible will be shown and are able to be selected. With the option set to false, all rules are shown in the list, but those that are not compatible cannot be selected. || Step 8: Search for your rule in the search field at the top | Expected: Search field searches/filters rules correctly.

With regards to what is available to the rule in this scenario, it will depend on where the rule is opened from - if the rule is opened from under Extension Point A, only Client will be available to use. If it is opened from under Extension Point B, Client and Matter will be available.
When editing and saving a rule, a validation check will occur to determine whether the rule is still compatible with the other Extension Points it is shared with. For example, if the rule is opened under Extension Point B and the rule is changed to use the Matter contract, then a dialog will pop up when you try to save the rule which will notify you that the rule is no longer compatible with Extension Point A. From here, you have two options - remove the reference to the incompatible Extension Point, or cancel the save and change the rule so it remains compatible.
Note: Local Variables/Contracts should not affect the matching between Rules and Extension Points on both the select existing function and when saving.
 
When it comes to different versions of rules, the compatibility check will be additive - that means if you edit a rule as a new version and remove the use of Client (for example), the check that occurs when saving will still check for Client compatibility - Client will still be a part of the rule's contracts.
--> Different versions are created when you edit a rule on a different day you created it (24 hours after creation)
 
 
 
Note: there is a Usages tab which will show all the extension points/areas where the rule is used - there will be another test case for this, however.

125882,Design Studio - Share Rules 03 - Edit a Rule shared with more than one Extension Point,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Applications\Design Studio\Rules,2015-11-19T21:46:31.743Z,"This Test Covers:
Editing a rule that is shared with more than one Extension Point
- Opening a rule from an extension point provides the use of only that Extension Point's contracts (not any other reference's contracts)
- Make general changes to the rule that doesn't make rule incompatible with shared Extension Points and save
- Edit rule to become incompatible with shared Extension Points and save
     --> Cancel Saving option
     --> Remove Association with incompatible Extension Points option
 
Background
We now have the ability to share one rule between several extension points that have compatible data contracts with the rule. You're able to create a rule under one extension point and then select that rule from another extension point so it can be used in both places. 

 

 
To check which data contracts are in a particular Extension Point, right-click on the Extension Point and click ""Properties"". This will bring you to a new tab where you can see what contracts are available. With regards to selecting an existing rule for this extension point, this just means that if you're using the Prebill Edit Disbursement Validation extension point, then you won't be able to select a rule with a condition of ""Time.BaseHours > 1"" as the ""Time"" contract is not in the list/available for this Extension Point. 

 
The rule can be edited under any of the extension points it is ""shared"" with and it will change for all - visually, it looks like there is just a rule with the same name under each extension point, but update one and they all update, rather than if you duplicated the rule and only the version you update gets updated.
 
With regards to the rule's contracts, a contract from the Extension Point will only be considered ""on"" the rule if the rule actually uses it. For example, if the rule is under Extension Points A (with Client contract) and B (with Client and Matter contracts), it will not have""Client"" and ""Matter"" contracts unless the rule uses them (speaking in terms of what the compatibility checks check against). 
With regards to what is available to the rule in this scenario, it will depend on where the rule is opened from - if the rule is opened from under Extension Point A, only Client will be available to use. If it is opened from under Extension Point B, Client and Matter will be available.
When editing and saving a rule, a validation check will occur to determine whether the rule is still compatible with the other Extension Points it is shared with. For example, if the rule is opened under Extension Point B and the rule is changed to use the Matter contract, then a dialog will pop up when you try to save the rule which will notify you that the rule is no longer compatible with Extension Point A. From here, you have two options - remove the reference to the incompatible Extension Point, or cancel the save and change the rule so it remains compatible.
 
When it comes to different versions of rules, the compatibility check will be additive - that means if you edit a rule as a new version and remove the use of Client (for example), the check that occurs when saving will still check for Client compatibility - Client will still be a part of the rule's contracts.
--> Different versions are created when you edit a rule on a different day you created it (24 hours after creation)

Check the available Data Variables/Contracts | Expected: Available Data Variables/Contracts are only those from the Extension Point you opened the rule from - for example, if the rule is shared with Prebill Edit Disbursement Validation and you open it from under Prebill Edit Time Validation, the contracts available would be Time, Client, etc. but no Disbursement. || Step 4: Make some changes to the rule - e.g. change the message on the Return activity if there is one, or change the name of the rule.

Open the rule from under Prebill Edit Disbursement Validation, and add a condition where Disbursement.DisbursementTypeId = ""AIR"". | Expected: A dialog pops up warning you that the changes you've made make the rule no longer compatible with another Extension Point. || Step 7: Choose ""Cancel Saving"" | Expected: User is returned back to the rule - changes have not been saved but are still on the rule, rule is ""dirty"". || Step 8: Save the rule again - this time choose ""Replace Association"" | Expected: User is prompted to type a new name for the rule || Step 9: Choose a name for the new rule and click ""OK"" | Expected: A new rule is created with all the changes you made. The old rule has been removed from under the Rule Point and replaced by the new rule. All other Rule Points still contain the old rule, which is as it was before you made any changes."

126724,Design Studio - Add Local Variables to Shared Rules,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Applications\Design Studio\Rules,2015-12-09T22:50:10.167Z,"This Test Covers:
- Rule Local Variables
     --> Add a Local Variable to a rule that is shared with more than one Extension Point
     --> Add a Local Variable to a rule and share the rule
 
Background:
We now have the ability to share one rule between several extension points that have compatible data contracts with the rule. You're able to create a rule under one extension point and then select that rule from another extension point so it can be used in both places. 


 
To check which data contracts are in a particular Extension Point, right-click on the Extension Point and click ""Properties"". This will bring you to a new tab where you can see what contracts are available. With regards to selecting an existing rule for this extension point, this just means that if you're using the Prebill Edit Disbursement Validation extension point, then you won't be able to select a rule with a condition of ""Time.BaseHours > 1"" as the ""Time"" contract is not in the list/available for this Extension Point. 

 
The rule can be edited under any of the extension points it is ""shared"" with and it will change for all - visually, it looks like there is just a rule with the same name under each extension point, but update one and they all update, rather than if you duplicated the rule and only the version you update gets updated.
 
With regards to the rule's contracts, a contract from the Extension Point will only be considered ""on"" the rule if the rule actually uses it. For example, if the rule is under Extension Points A (with Client contract) and B (with Client and Matter contracts), it will not have ""Client"" and ""Matter"" contracts unless the rule uses them (speaking in terms of what the compatibility checks check against). 
With regards to what is available to the rule in this scenario, it will depend on where the rule is opened from - if the rule is opened from under Extension Point A, only Client will be available to use. If it is opened from under Extension Point B, Client and Matter will be available.
When editing and saving a rule, a validation check will occur to determine whether the rule is still compatible with the other Extension Points it is shared with. For example, if the rule is opened under Extension Point B and the rule is changed to use the Matter contract, then a dialog will pop up when you try to save the rule which will notify you that the rule is no longer compatible with Extension Point A. From here, you have two options - remove the reference to the incompatible Extension Point, or cancel the save and change the rule so it remains compatible.
Note: Local Variables/Contracts should not affect the matching between Rules and Extension Points on both the select existing function and when saving.
 
When it comes to different versions of rules, the compatibility check will be additive - that means if you edit a rule as a new version and remove the use of Client (for example), the check that occurs when saving will still check for Client compatibility - Client will still be a part of the rule's contracts.
--> Different versions are created when you edit a rule on a different day you created it (24 hours after creation)

The PS script needs to be copied to ExpertShare folder on any site/region and run from there: Run PowerShell as admin, change diretory to ExpertShare and run .\EDE_app_setup.ps1 
 
-          Environment details are picked from FWM_ENVIRONMENT table, so you will need to ensure that the entries in this table are all valid (Clean up invalid ones) before running this script. (e.g. All participating EDE nodes should have an entry in this table)

 
-          For now we only setup Expensesand Prebill. You can easily add additional applications in the script by adding a new line under $apps and specify the application exe name.

 
-          The modified files all outputs to C:\Temp\EDE, this can be changed by specifying $TargetPathRoot.
 
-          Output folder should look like below. Check that files are renamed correctly with actual environment name, check the config files are in UTF-8 encoding, check the content of the config files that North configs have binding URL to North server and South configs have binding to South server.

Background:
We now have the ability to share one form between several form points that have compatible data contracts with the form. You're able to create a form under one form point and then select that form from another form point so it can be used in both places.

To check which data contracts are in a particular Form Point, right-click on the Form Point and click ""Properties"". This will bring you to a new tab where you can see what contracts are available. With regards to selecting an existing form for this form point, this just means that if you're using the Disbursement Split form point, then you won't be able to select a form using any data from a ""Time"" contract (e.g. a form under ""Time Split""), as the Time contract is not in the list/available for this Form Point.

Goal
Workflows should be displayed in Design Studio under the appropriate product. To enable this the workflow definition needs to contain the ProductId to which it belongs.
Reason
As we get more and more workflows, having everything all in one place gets messy, so we need to separate the workflows out to their own products to make it easier to work with.Define Done
- Development workflows (create a new workflow -> Build Solution) and Published workflows (import workflow package) are found under both Expert Workflow ""product"" node AND an Expert Workflow node under the product the workflow belongs to (PRODUCT_ID in WFM_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION)
- Can change the workflow product in workflow properties, location in Design Studio alters accordingly (e.g. used to be under Expert Assistant, now under Expert Billing)
- Product for new Workflows is defaulted to ""Expert Workflow""Design Ideas- Have an ""Expert Workflow"" node which acts similar to the Expert System > Form Repository node - this will be a repository for ALL workflows, development and published. 
- Have ""Expert Workflow"" nodes under each of the products that have a workflow - this is determined by a new PRODUCT_ID column in WFM_WORKFLOW_DEFINITION, which comes off the Product field in workflow properties (defaulted to Expert Workflow for new workflows)","Step 1: Click on the Workflow Properties button in the design toolbar.

It is the is the upgraded version of Smart Form Task v3 Activity which is used for Smartform v1 and v2.
It uses the same concept as Extension Point for Rules in Design Studio, which means the configuration of the Form point and association of SmartForms are done in Design Studio.


Form Points are created from Workflow designer (Currently, Visual Studio) - Form Point Activity.

Form Points are configured in Design Studio, under Expert Workflow section

Form Points are Workflow specific (Same as SmartFormTaskv3)

Data contract of Form point is defined by 'Parameters'. The Form point does not use data contract directly from the Workflow.

You can have as many Form Points in a Workflow

You can have as many SmartForms attached to a Form Point

SmartForms can be shared across different Workflows and Form Points, as long as they are compatible (Same as SmartFormTaskv3)

SmartForms can be attached to a Form Point in Design Studio
On the Workflow designer, the Form Point activity has the following properties:



Task Name: Task name to be displayed. String type, can be bind to a String variable.

Parameters: List of variables (data contracts) to pass into the associated SmartForms

Form Point: Create the Form Point in Design Studio

Security Plan: Configure user/group security rights to this Task (e.g. Configure who is the Task performer)
Form Point activity also shares the same workflow properties as SmartFormTaskv3 activity:

 
Clicking on ""Form Point: Configure"" will create the Form Point and launch the configuration screen. 
In this screen, you can attach/edit/remove SmartForms 
You can access this screen again by right clicking on the Form point in Design Studio and select ""Add/edit items"".
At this stage, the Form Point is created.

2. Test that Form Point and its associated SmartForms only use the defined parameters as their data contract. It should NOT use any Workflow variable directly as data contract.
 
3. Test that after defining the Workflow and Form points Visual Studio, you can add more SmartForms to the Form point on the fly inside Design Studio. The SmartForms added later should correctly showup for all consumers at runtime.",Step 1: See Summary Page for full details

-System level: 0
-Firm level: 10
 
Available functionalities in Design Studio:
-Create new System: When system owner is Aderant. (Aderant Dev only )
-Create new Firm: When system owner is not Aderant
-Edit System: Create a Firm version of the selected Data Provider, it will have the same Path as the system copy and all references to this Data provider now refers to the new Firm copy
-Edit Firm
-Duplicate System/Firm: Create a firm copy of the selected Data Provider, it will have different Path than the selected and concidered as a new registration.
 
Test Cases:
1. If System owner is not Aderant, System level Data providers are not editable in the Designer. 
Firms need to create a Firm copy of the selected DP if they wish to make any customization.
""Path"" and ""Scope"" properties are the identifiers.
 
2. Firm can discard their Firm customization of the selected DP and revert back to the system version. 
All apps should correctly pickup the version with the highest scope (0 for system, 10 for Firm)
 
3. DP Properties and property values are correctly saved and consumed at runtime.
 
4. When creating a DP, you can only change ""Data Provider"" selection. ""Return Data Type"" dropdown is readonly and poplates depending on the selection in ""Data Provider"" dropdown.
 
5. When editing a DP, you cannot change ""Data Provider"" selection",

- When exporting data providers, if the data provider has both firm and system versions, and it is exported, the firm version should be picked for exporting.
- If only system, nothing happens - the DP is already in the system package
   - Also if the data provider has multiple versions and effective dates, only the most recent one should be picked
 
- Also it is impractical to test exporting all data providers and their properties - so we will test:
   - Client dataprovider and properties set
   - Matter DP and properties
   - Employee DP and properties
 
Testing approach
 
Original environment
- Create a firm version of the client, matter, and employee data provider
    - Ensure you have filter expression set on some of the exported data providers
- Create a package under Firm scope, and search for data providers
  - Only firm definitions of data providers are displayed/ available for inclusion into package
- Save package, and open package in design studio
   - Double click the data providers to ensure they are pointing to the firm scoped data providers that you created [bug]
- Export Package
  - Check Package contents - data provider definition is exported [ bug]
 
Other environment
- Reimport package to another environment
- Check tables
  - FWM_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION - New Data providers have been saved
  - FWA_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION_PROP - Data provider properties have been transferred
- Open firm data providers in new environment",

The data provider upgrader picks up configure values from Technical.Presentation.DataProviders. Non xml values are excluded.
- This is the reason why the list in 
select *
from CFM_CONFIGURATION_VALUE
where NAMEID in (select ID
from CFM_CONFIGURATION_NAME
where path like 'Technical.Presentation.DataProviders%')
is less than the # of dataproviders in FWM-DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION
The upgraded DPs are stored in FWM_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION table, and properties stored in FWA_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION_PROP
The upgrader checks if the configure value path already exist in the table(FWM_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION) before performing the upgrade
 
The use cases are:
- Old data providers / data providers that are currently working and NOT in FWM_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION will be migrated
- After migration, the data providers can be used in our Forms
 
Testing approach
 
Assuming we have a database that already has upgrade data providers...
 
1. Remove a particular row from FWM_DATA_QUERY_DEFINITION, as well as the related table

Also check that one property from each of the tabs can be used in a 'complex' filtering condition

 
Note that the current implementation applies filtering on the client side i.e. fiddler will still catch everything when the results are sent back from the server.
Future versions will implement the filtering on the server side to stop results from being 'snoop-able'
 
Testing approach
 
Pick an existing data provider to test with - ideally we want a data provider that is used on a Form that you can find e.g. Employee dataprovider:

We can do several expressions like:
and then search on a Billing Form that uses this dataprovider, eg the Disbursement Split Form: (note you need to save changes on the data provider prior to searching on the Form.


Test both positive and negative search results:

We also want to test with slightly complex expressions:
 
Item.TerminateDate = Null
Item.HireDate < Today
Item.BookId = 1
 
And chaining these together for a more complex evaluation:
if Security.User.Department = ""ADM"" then Item.OfficeId = ""TLH"" else Item.OfficeId = ""BUF""
  
 
Save changes
 
Test via Application Form:
e.g.

The search result after each expression change should satisfy the filter expressions.",

We can verify the created asset (in this case a form) is unattached as there are no data contracts (which normally exists on an extension point and is inherited by its assets)

from FWM_SMARTFORM
where SMART_FORM_UNO in (2)
 
In this case, I had edited the Disbursement split smartform under 

but you can perform the edit anywhere else.
 
2. Reimport the package containing a system level definition of the smartform
Find where your package is (usually under Expertsource\packages) and look inside using Design studio:
Verify the smartform definition is contained within, then import the smartform.

3.  Launch Deployment Manager
- Need to change splash screen to display version 81 - raised as bug
3.a Expert Database Details dialog is displayed - user is able to provide Expert Database Name, and User name and password for the database
- What is the user credential used to log into the database server? - Windows security. However, as per current documentation the deployment user is required to have access to the database servers they are going to deploy to - so this is not a concern
- In the case where the user is not allowed to log onto the database server, what happens? 
   - Currently it displays the list of databases from the last valid connection made within the application session - raised as bug 
- If the database details are updated, the validation error on the server name field is not removed. It is removed when the validation error is on the instance name field, however. - Raised as bug
- Can the list of databases be alphabetically ordered to make finding databases easier? - Raised as bug
- We seem to be doing something smart around the case where a db server is provided, but no instance has been provided, and no databases are found - do we default mssql10 into the instance and then try again automatically? - incorrect - we load the list of databases from the last valid connection

Ensure the database has been used in a deployment, and has a manifest in FWM_ENVIRONMENT
Publish a few workflows and start instances of these workflows
Then backup the database
 
Take the backup, and restore it on a server that you have access to e.g. SVSQL304.

However we are not looking to test the creation, export and import of the above in this test case - this is done in other test cases. 
 
We are just looking at creating a new package, attaching a config value, smartform, and a rule, then exporting it to examine the contents. In particular, we are looking at creating new packages via the ribbon and via right clicking.
 
Testing approach
 
Create a package via right click or the ribbon, then add a config value, a smartform, and a rule. Save the package.
Check FWM_PACKAGE_SPECIFICATION to see if the Package has been created.
Then check  FWM_PACKAGE_SPEC_CONTENT to see the number of items associated with the package
 
Then export the package, and check its contents - this is currently the fastest way to determine whether we've associated our components with the package correctly
The package zip file should contain the config value, the smartform definition, and the rule definition that you included in the package in the zip.",

Collect fiddler logs to measure the startup time of each application
Also identify the service calls invoked during startup via the fiddler logs

Collect fiddler logs against the same set of applications, and check the startup time
Check the service calls and, using the provided documentation, look for any service calls that are in the 'black list'
Also check Event viewer for any error events related to the startup work e.g. any error events referencing the startup cache is related
 
Email from Jamie on the results of the testing done on the startup work:
 
Hi all,
 
Last Friday Franklin and I captured data on the application startup for Rates, Billing, Collections, Expenses, Time, MatterWorks and WIP Review on Main.BuildAll_20160824.5. 
 
Test Process:
1.       Logging was set to Info level.
2.       The cache was cleared prior to starting each application, but IIS was not reset (we were not sure if this step was necessary or not, please advise if this step should be included in future testing). 
3.       Captured service calls for each application startup using Fiddler
4.       Monitored Event Viewer for info level events to do with application startup
 
All event logs to do with “Could not use application startup cache” are summarised in the attached Excel document. Event logs are attached. Service calls for each application captured using Fiddler. Fiddler logs also attached.
 
Observations of service requests which looked like they matched criteria listed in the documentation for service calls that should be combined:
Billing:
Identity
MatterWorks:
Current employee
Rates:
Configuration cache eviction
Help links
Security
Employees
Time:
MRU
Extension points
Employees
WIP Review:
Current employee
 
Testing plan going forward will be to retest on application launch for service calls if any changes are made.
 
If there are any ideas regarding adding integration tests for the changes to application startup, that would be very beneficial moving forward.
 
I retested 151716 and it was indeed environment related. Restarting the services via Deployment Manager solved the issue.

162583,Framework - Architecture - Security - Making sure SSN and Salary are masked for non-admin users,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Architecture\Security,2017-02-16T02:28:18.14Z,"Apart from Admin users and our Expert Applications, if the user tried to view the data they will instead see ""*"" 's in place of the data.
Note that SYSADMIN and DBOWNER users bypass this security, so they can see the data - but their rights can also be revoked. The data masking facility is to make sure SQL-based snooping by non-users are HARD - there are still ways to infer masked data from other sources.
 
Note that this feature is only available in 8.1.1, and ONLY if the environment is using SQL Server 2016. Environments deployed on earlier versions of SQL Server will not have this feature enabled.
 
The tables storing the data concerned are:
 
select ANNUAL_SALARY, *
from BDA_EMPLOYEE
 
select SALARY, *
from BDA_EMPL_ASSIGN_PERIOD
　
select ssn, *
from HBM_NAME_PEOPLE
 
select ssn, *
from KEY_CMSCLIENT
 
select ssn,*
from KEY_CMSPERSONNEL
 
The areas where we need to check if the data is hidden correctly:
 
SQL Server query sessions
Application UI & Reporting
Exporting / Importing excel sheets containing the salary info
 
Application UI vs SQL Server
 

If the user has rights to use the application, show the data as intended
Otherwise, if the user is not an administrator, they should see ""*"" or 0's when querying data.
 
Exporting the Salary - This is viewable, and follows the same train of thought - if the user can use the application (and then export the data), then it should be viewable once exported. The user has made a conscious decision and it is their responsibility to keep this information safe, once exported.
 
Test that the salary can still be exported and reimported (data masking shouldn't have affected this functionality)
 
Test that the reports which retrieve salary still display the data as expected:

In Case - Ensure SSN is not available as a search filter in contacts, on the Personal View -> Advanced Search tab.",

Create a basic smartform
Upgrade this smartform either through Design studio > Double click, or go through the Smartform Upgrade Wizard process.
An upgrade report is generated and saved at the Roaming profile location e.g. C:\Users\franklin.liu\AppData\Roaming\Aderant\Local\UpgradeReports
On opening the upgraded smartform, if there's an associated report, the user can click on the information alert to open the report (which opens the report HTML page)
The user can also choose to delete the report - which removes the page from the cache
Only the user who upgraded the smartform can see the report (because that's where the report is stored) - other users opening the upgraded smartform will see nothing.",

[question: is this toggle-able? Or always on, and is dependent on the log4net settings?][answer: always on, since 8.1.1]
 
An additional security appender has been added to Log4net, which looks like below:
   <!-- Security Logger -->  <!-- Note: Does not inherit from root. -->  <logger name=""Aderant.Security"" additivity=""False"">    <level value=""ERROR"" />    <appender-ref ref=""SecurityAppender"" />  </logger> 
 
Usage is the same as the other log4net appenders, in that the level value will determine the level of message logged in event viewer.
Attempts are logged to Event Viewer (as well as DebugView if that's running), with the source set to Aderant Security.
This means the event viewer log can be filtered based on this specific source, if the firm wants to conduct a security audit.
 
Events that are logged:
- Failed attempts to get rights. 
All applications where user access failed, should generate a log entry
 
- Administrative applications - the app and the user access are logged.

Domain Wizard
Deployment manager
Security Manager
Configuration Manager
Package Manager Console
Design Studio
Smartform wizard
Expert Administration
Schedule Manager
Regardless of failure or success, access is logged for admin applications.
 
Testing approach
 
Setup user for positive access to all apps
Setup user for negative access to all apps
 
Changes haven't been made to the security mechanism / infrastructure, only to log the events, so this is a low risk feature.
 
Check that if users proxied attempt to start applications e.g. Franklin proxied TTQA1 in EA, then started other applications - the log should display the TTQA credentials in the log events.

175445,"Users can deploy 82 with an independent WF database, with Appfabric installed",Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow,2017-08-17T00:00:15.64Z,"Things to test
Two environments:
- Local
- Load balanced
 
We will not test the scenario without Appfabric installed, as only clients upgrading will traverse this path. New clients on 82 will NOT be able to deploy with an independent WF database because the workflow database name will default to the Expert database name.
 
On each environment:
- Deployment works
- Workflows from the independent WF database has been merged across to the Expert database
  - Table persistence
  - Running workflow instances from previous deployment can be completed, and New instances can be started and completed
  - Events and completion status is carried over
    - Workflow status on running instances prior to upgrade
    - Workflow instance management in Workflow Admin continues to work? Completed records?
- 3rd party utility route also works? Check if this makes it for 82
- Confirm with Paul if we need to check for anything else from the merge process

We don't need to test the scenario without appfabric, as the upgrade path will always include Appfabric as per requirement of our older releases.
 
The oldest line to upgrade from should be 803HF4 / 803HF5, as that is where most of our non-upgraded clients are currently.

One use case per application. Include SQL to ensure the target data is 0 when querying the view.

-          Look for the same Bill in App (run this SQL to see Bills in your app: update BLT_BILL set EB_INITIATED = 'Y')
o   Test Result: OK, although I had to use sql to adjust the PrebillAdminEmployeeId to 0 as the UI does not allow me to do so.
 
Budgeting:
- Nothing tested - see below
- Used the following view:
- However did not proceed through as none of the computed columns are expected to be zero if the data was well-formed. This applied for the other views that I saw for Budgeting.

Questions
- What security resources if any are required for users to add user / application pairs in this grid?
None
- When does logging start? Does the user / application need to restart their application in order for logging to take place? Or can we start something on the fly?
Applications start logging at the specified level as soon the config is saved. No IISRESET required.
- If there is definition for user/application when the user visits the application backstage, will this show? Can users affect logging here?
This is answered in 176189.
 
The available logging levels for toggling follows the Log4net hierarchy: (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) 

 
This does not test the actual execution of logging that consumes the parameters (refactor this when we have information on functionality) - this is covered in another test case",
176189,"Logging configurations created from backstage appears in Expert Admin, and vice versa.",Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Operational Insights,2017-08-27T23:38:51.97Z,"Testing Approach
 
Users can setup the user / logging level / application combinations in Expert Admin.
 

 
Users are also able to initiate logging from any WPF application backstage (web applications excluded), by clicking on the start logging button.

This will add a row into the same area in Expert Administration -> Logging Configuration

Check that:
- If user starts a logging session from the backstage of an application, a row is added for the user / application  in Expert Administration
  Confirmed OK. 
- If a row has been added for a user/ application pair in Expert Administration, the user would see logging enabled when traversing to the application backstage.
  Waiting for reply from Jason and Heath.
Currently user sees nothing from backstage. If the user attempts to start logging from application backstage, they will see the following dialog:

 
- If a row has been added for a user/ application pair in Expert Administration, other users can still start logging for the same application from the application backstage, as well as from Expert Adminsitration.

This should also be the initial holding place for looking at ALL the data that are captured in a log file. May need to refactor this out later on.
 
Session data relates to Application scope generated data. 
- These may exist independently of Activity and Event data... confirm?
 
Activity data relates to business activity / transactions / things that happen inside an application
- These could exist independently...? Confirm
 
Event data relates to individual calls that are usually initiated by Activities to further transaction progress

176195,"Users are able to, based on an error log entry, find the log and get further information",Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Operational Insights,2017-08-27T23:55:44.713Z,"Assuming a user has just encountered an error they could reproduce:
 
And assuming they have the following goals:
1 Get more information
2 Collate logs for escalation to support
3 Setup logging for tracking the issue / related issues later on
 
Assuming the user has the following information as well to search / filter with:
- User
Myself
- Application

- Point of time when error occurred

- Error log from event viewer / application ""more information""

 
Goal 1a:
  Possibly the best way to get information is to limit it by application. Go to System monitor via Expert Assistant -> Actions, then go to the Events tab on System Monitor page.
 
Click on the application we want (MatterWorks)

Then click on the associated session that matches our timestamp

And then click on the Logs link to view all associated logs
 
Now we could also look through the business activities or service calls - but this depends on the application hooking into our new logging infrastructure, so we'll instead go to the most common route - the Logs page (where everyone ends up eventually, anyways).

On this page, we can use our data to further filter the deluge of information that's currently displayed to us.
*Note that for logging inquiries, the search uses the terms user has entered in a 'Starts with...' search pattern. So in our case, we needed to look at our error message output from event viewer: ""ERROR [1] Attempted to divide by zero.System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero.""
Therefore our search term in the Messages box is 'Attempt'. This implementation may change in the future, but for now this is how it works.

Now that we've tracked down the error message, we might want to see if there was anything useful before or after the message. We can use the filters to help us find the messages we want - but we'll need to clear the Message criterion so we pull back all logs. However we'll want to make sure only certain level logs are being pulled back - this depends on the environment default (WARN if untouched), in our case we assume logging had already been elevated when we collected our logs, so there might be something useful from INFO level or above:

If you remember from the previous step, the ID of the log entry we're interested in is 7663. So after everything has been returned, we can now use the column headers to help us quickly narrow down things:

You can sort the date header by descending (assuming you are investigating logs straight after encountering the error), and then scroll down the page until you locate 7663. At this point, all you need is to scroll slightly up and down from this entry to see what was logged prior, and after, your application error!
 
 
Goal 1b: 
  We can also go via the Errors route if we see our error from the stacktrace present on the page:
Since we don't, we click into the Errors heading to see if we can find our error:
 

All log entries at the error level are retrieved, irrespective of the session ID (which specifies the user / application context of the log entry captured).
 
Since we have the error message, we can attempt to narrow down our error log entry using the Message field. As noted above, the search is performed using Start with, so given the error message we'll need to use the word 'Attempt' to retrieve our error message:
 
 
Now that we have our error message, click into the ID to view more information associated:

We now have the session ID to retrieve the rest of the logs - so we should now click into the session ID, and then click on Logs, and follow the rest of the steps as described in 1a. 
 
As you may have realized, clicking through the errors is actually the longer way - the encouraged and intuitive use case / path is through the target application where you encountered your issue!
 
Goal 2a - Collating logs for escalation
 
Inquirys offers two export options; once we're on the page with the logs we want displayed, we can export to PDF or export to Excel (recommended)

Excel is recommended here because the posterity of the logs are preserved; in the PDF version, the column width may prevent information from being read and there is no way to see past the column width limitation. Everything is preserved when exporting to excel.
 
Goal 2b - Optional step and combined with Goal 3.
 
If the user is able to reproduce the issue, then what they can do is to setup the application logging from its backstage:
 

A Caveat: if the issue is of the crashing type - we won't be able to utilize this feature as the backstage logging mechanism relies on the application in a not-shutdown state.
 
If the issue isn't of the crashing type, then we can use this to package the captured logs (in .log format) alongside environmental information all collated inside a zip file, ready to be sent to someone that can help!
 
As per the above screenshot, pressing the Email Support from the application backstage will generate a nice diagnostics package filled with environmental information as well as any logs that could be captured. In our case, since we've already exported the logs we're interested in investigation by the developers, we can simply piggy back on this feature, and attach our exported logs to the email:
 

 
Goal 3
 
If we can reproduce the error (non-crashing) and want to capture all logs associated with the session, then we can set thnigs up via the application backstage .

 
However, if the application in question is crashing upon repeating those same steps, we will need to proceed to Expert Administration to setup logging for the application:
 

In this case, I've created a logging configuration for matterworks so that everytime I use it, the environment will capture any logs generated at the debug level or higher. This will ensure I capture all the things that might help my developer track down the root cause and fix the issue!
 
Any logging config created here will be cleaned up after 7 days - the expiration is available inside the logging config table (INSTRUMENTATION.FWM_LOG_CONFIG) but not visible on the UI. This is by design so the user won't be tempted to try and change the logging period (because this might be running and forgotten on a production system - a bad combination).",

The Logging summary data is displayed in System monitor; a new tab has been created to display a limited aggregated view of the captured calls and durations from the logging table, from the prescribed logging configuration for the environment:

Assumption: These headings should correspond to the Logging inquiries available for selection from the Inquiries: All Lists section.
 
On this page, the amount of records available can be filtered based on time period, and # of records under each heading.
Check that:
- Changing the time period correctly returns the # of rows that matches the criteria, and only logging entries fitting inside the timeframe
- Changing the # of rows viewable will show more / less rows as per the selected setting

177348,Preliminary testing on Paul's changes to remove dependence from AppFabric,Closed,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow,2017-09-13T09:57:59.21Z,"Most of the contents here are summarized from the Appfabric independence document I have been curating to document testing and questions asked for the project.
 
Testing approach
 
Paul's changes mainly target the kicking off mechanism of workflows; we've changed from using Appfabric to using our Aderant-rolled mechanism, but the end-result remains the same, we still expect workflows to start. Still, our testing targets end-to-end completion of workflows including initiation, mechanisms including toaster notification, assign / reassign, checking status, and data persistence on completing the workflow.
 
The main test is completing the FO workflow. Starting from publishing the workflow, then kicking it off from expert assistant, and completing the subsequent tasks.
 
The major challenge of testing is actually in the deployment phase; while some problems were encountered as part of the initial set of changes by Paul e.g. during deployment, others were due to the hand-cobbled nature of the binaries provided by Paul. Syncing from master has been hit and miss on most occassions, and it requires several tries and debugging and confirmation with environments in product teams to confirm issues encountered are transient / non-reproducible outside the scope of Paul's changes.
 
Things tested:
- FO workflow - completion end to end. Though initiating the workflow was the main concern, completing the workflow tasks will serve to increase confidence in the things we've done.
- Billing workflow - kicking off some workflows that used the service callback capability - e.g. prepare prebill and the job infrastructure. We need to verify this use case has not been disrupted. Billing team has been very helpful in resolving some environmental issues and incorrect approach in data setup. Eventual outcome was successful with Billing related testing.
- MatterWorks workflow - Due to some problems encountered during billing workflow testing, so I opted to explore workflow capability in other applications. MatterWorks workflow initiated successfully, but there are some problems that appears to be product related which I've communicated with the matterworks team to followup.
- Expenses workflow - Able to initiate and progress to Corrections task due to local setup issues. But workflow could be initiated and tasks received properly.

DBConfigWizard is the utility clients use to upgrade their databases. It must contain all the database changes in the release, and any additional changes will require a new version of DBConfigWizard.
This is the first step that must pass before we can consider deploying an environment.
 
Steps
 
Find DBConfigWizard. The location changes depending on what your current release is. 
For releases older than 81GA: Should be either part of the binaries \ buildall, or provided and built by SCM.
For releases more recent (since Deployment manager became MSI'd): Binaries\ExpertSource\DbConfigWizard
 
Ensure you have no prior versions installed, or else the MSI won't install
 
Once installed, the files will either be:
- Program files - somewhere under the Aderant folder
- AderantExpert\Install\DBUpgradeWizard
 
Fill out your details, and run - waiting for the wizard to finish running.
 
If there are problems, there wil be a log file generated - just follow the path displayed on the dialog.
- It will be helpful for the family developer to fix the issue if they have detailed information on how the script fails. In order to get more information, you'll need to do an individual run of the failed scripts. Either re-run in DBGen or via SSMS. Where the failure is due to .maskederrors or something specific to DBGen syntax, you'll need to re-run in DBGen to reproduce the issue.

179692,Design studio toolbar is installed correctly after a successful deployment,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow,2017-10-18T03:13:06.97Z,"Things to test
 
Design studio toolbar is Aderant's extension to enable our clients to design workflows in general. There is no other tool that we provide them which facilitates this.
 
The toolbar is installed as part of any success Expert deployment.
 
If installed correctly, upon opening Visual studio you'll see this toolbar available:

The easiest way to determine if this has been installed successfully is to:
- Open a workflow solution
- Observe the activity surfaces - for example the smartform tasks should display the task name, the smart form, and security policy buttons:
You should be able to click into those buttons to invoke the dialogs where you can enter in detailed information / make selections / etc. 
 
- View the Workflow properties
- The workflow should build - CTRL + SHIFT + B or right click on the project / solution and select build.
- There should be no errors when building the vanilla template workflow solutions
- Running the workflow via the green play button - this starts a development workflow instance. If you're using FileOpening as the template workflow, it should start the first MatterIntake task. 
 
If we can get this far, then we can ascertain Design Studio toolbar is in a decent state.
 
 
Additional information / checks
This toolbar is installed as a Visual studio extension, which means if installed correctly, it'll have the following options

With the expert location set to the expertshare location of the customization workstation / current machine. If this is set incorrectly then there will be issues:
- Toolbar may not appear
- Workflow solutions may not build
- Activities do not display / work correctly
- Workflows may not run
 
Case in point / Fringe case: See linked bug 168627, where the client has deployed an environment with an expertshare location that is not C:\expertshare.
In this case, the extension's ExpertLocation will need to be manually set, and visual studio restarted, before the user can continue the workflow experience.",

Complete the above steps and you'll be able to start developing your new workflow... but you'll want to complete the following steps for extra points.
 
Editing process security: This will allow you to determine which user(s) / groups will have access to interact with the workflow process / instance. This means suspending workflow, terminating / cancelling, or resuming from a faulted state. This will not be tested in this test case.
 
Editing Global task security: This will allow you to determine which user(s) / groups can interact with the task. Those without rights to interact with the task will not be able to complete the task. This will not be tested in this test case.

Basic workflow test - logging activity. 
This is the quickest way to check a workflow could be started, run to the end, and complete successfully.
 
 
Some common troubleshooting tips / things to confirm:
 
Confirming the workflow solution has been created successfully:

If an IIS application has been created for the workflow solution, then you're ready to go. This will enable:
- Running of the workflow
- Exporting the workflow into a package for publishing in an environment
 
Confirming the workflow design surface is ready to go:
 
Sometimes after creating a new workflow the design surface is displayed with some errors:

Just rebuild the solution and the surface should be ready. If it doesn't work, check the ExpertLocation setting in Visual studio, and re-install the Design Studio VSIX extension and see if that helps. If nothing works, then ask Paul for help or raise a bug if errors are spotted in event viewer.",
179699,Design Studio - Users publish development workflows,Design,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Workflow,2017-10-18T04:14:00.643Z,"Things to Test
 
In order to publish workflows, the workflow solution must have been opened in Visual Studio once.
 
This creates an entry for the workflow in IIS:

If this is in place, then you should be able to see the workflow when picking the workflow for inclusion into your package:
- Create new package
- On the components filter list, select workflow projects:

Your development workflow should be visible like so:
Select your workflow, then hit export:

Verify the export process has proceeded successfully:

We trust the logs... but we should verify ourselves.
Open the package:
There should be a manifest at the root level.
Deeper, there will be zips for the solution, as well as the exported definition of the workflow

 
The ultimate litmus test is to import the workflow package and publish the workflow, then invoke the workflow (via an action, now that it's published you can't start the workflow like a development workflow), and complete the workflow end-to-end.",

Whenever the user attempts to modify the data provider, they will be asked to create a firm version for their changes.
Users are able to revert changes they've made to the data provider via the ribbon menu:

Firm versions and property values are saved in the same location as the system version, with the tables named below.

180335,"Users can switch between deploying to separate logging database, or with integrated logging into Expert",Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Operational Insights,2017-10-26T04:27:04.123Z,"Testing Approach
 
When the user switches from integrated logging to a separate logging database, we are able to transport the logging data to the new logging database because the prior location of stored logging is well-known.
 
On the other hand, when the user switches from a separate logging database configuration to an integrated solution (which is not a recommended configuration to begin with), they will not have the benefit of carrying over their old logs to the new configuration. This is because the old configuration database is now omitted from the environment manifest, and therefore we do not have any way of discovering what the previous database was. (it also wasn't designed this way as there was no requirement to support this)

Users can click into the ID of the user session that matches the timestamp of interest, which will allow the user to further select logs associated with the select session ID:

Clicking into the hyperlinks will provide a filtered view of logs associated with the Session ID, as well as the selected hyperlink as an additional filter e.g. Business Activities:
 

We can then click on Logs (or service calls) to filter the logs by that attribute:

182115,Old Logging data is cleaned up via a scheduled job,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Operational Insights,2017-11-13T22:47:21.6Z,"Testing Approach
 
Confirm how long we keep the logging data first
 
Currently in the SP's, we keep logs from up to 180 days ago for both User session and business data

For general logging data, we keep it according to the following schedule:

 We can quickly check whether certain rows are retained or not by updating the dates on some dummy log entries, and then running the job.
Sample SQL here:
select *
from Instrumentation.FWM_LOG
where SERVICECALLID = '7A209B0B-8DFD-41F2-B01B-B6E10AA4AF25' 
and THREAD = 'Scheduler_Worker-5'
and MESSAGE = 'AutodiscoverLocalException - Unable to connect to Exchange Server using the provided email account: franklin.liu@aderant.com'
 
Let's boundary test. Find the date diff between these log entries and today (this is the age of the log entries)
select DATEDIFF(dd,'2017-11-15 23:01:07.010',getdate())
This returns '1'
 
Then we can add 178 to the dates and run the job - expect the logs to stay:
update Instrumentation.FWM_LOG
set DATE = dateadd(dd,-178,DATE)
where SERVICECALLID = '7A209B0B-8DFD-41F2-B01B-B6E10AA4AF25' 
and THREAD = 'Scheduler_Worker-5'
and MESSAGE = 'AutodiscoverLocalException - Unable to connect to Exchange Server using the provided email account: franklin.liu@aderant.com'
 
The select statement from before should still return our two rows. We can confirm this by running the independent piece of logic in the SP to confirm (our log entries are errors, so using the error retention days below):
SELECT TOP 1 ID
FROM Instrumentation.FWM_LOG WITH(NOLOCK)
WHERE LEVEL = 'Error' AND Date <= DATEADD(dd, -180, GETDATE())
 
Now we add 1 more day to the dates of these two log entries, then run the job:
 
The job rows are still there. Is this a bug? Running the logic returns us no rows, so I guess this is as designed!
 
Lets add 1 more day to the dates of the two log entries again. We would definitely expect the log entries to be removed this time.
Checking with the partial SP logic:
ID's are starting to be returned, so we'd expect our log entries to disappear after running the job. And it did!
The SQL Select statement as well as the partial SP logic select statements returns no results when run.
 
Given the order of magnitude of the # of days we're working with in regards to the logging data retention, as well as the low level of business risk associated, the fact that logging entries aren't cleared when they are exactly 180 days old shouldn't be an issue here.
 
The more important question that we should address / keep an eye out for is the retention date itself in the first instance. Depending on how much the monitoring database grows, we may need to advise clients on different approaches they can take against the amount of logging they want to preserve.",

To determine if they've run properly:
 
Use the attached SQL script, and run the select statements for each section.
Each section corresponds to each job (read the description), and the select script will allow us to obtain a snapshot of the database state prior to running the job.
 
After the snapshot has been obtained, run the job.
We would expect thereafter:
- The statistics / values has changed. 
- The job run has been recorded and it has run successfully or failed (we expect success)
 
With the FullText fragmentation check job, we expect there to be some results indicating an object in the database has fulltext fragmentation.
Running the job would remove this object from the select result
 
With the Index fragmentation script, some object with high fragmentation (on average) will be returned by the select statement; after running the job, we expect the number of results returned to decrease.
 
With the statistics check script, this is harder to ascertain if anything has happened; just pick a popular table out of the list (or several), that has had rows added to it since the last time the job was run, and capture a screenshot of these tables.

188774,EA Launcher copes with LOCKED files on update,Closed,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\MSIs\Expert Launcher,2018-03-06T23:59:59.303Z,"If Billing is running, and the share has been updated with new files that Billing needs. Someone launches Billing via EA Pro to update Billing - what happens?
 
In this case where client applications are using a file that needs to be updated, the user would receive the following dialog:

 
And they would not be able to update until all applications using this file is closed. The dialog also provides information on what applications need to be closed from the client side for the updates to proceed.
 
To Test:
- Find ExpertShareManifest.zip, and MAKE A BACKUP OF THIS SOMEWHERE. You'll need this to restore your environment to the original condition at the end of this test.
- Extract the zip, and look for a file that is definitely being used by the application you want to test with e.g. Aderant.Framework.dll
- Change the hash value - this will force EA launcher to evaluate the local files in the Applications folder as different, therefore outdated, and it will force an upgrade attempt on the file. As an example, you can change the hash value like so:
<file fileName=""Aderant.Framework.dll"" directory="""" lastModified=""2018-03-01T04:32:26Z"" fileHash=""1A9023D71DFA422555CDDE2EE67BD37E"" fileVersion=""1.8.6634.47876"" />

The HTTP Download functionality will fall back to assembly resolving and grab files via Expertshare when the HTTP Downloads location is inaccessible.
 
To Test:
 
- Go to your Aderant.ExpertLauncherInstaller location, and open the Aderant.ExpertLauncherCO.exe.config file:

- Change the ExpertSharePath to the expertshare folder, like in the image above. Doing so will essentially disable HTTP Downloads and revert EA Launcher to use assembly resolving as the approach towards getting the files it needs. Note: No need to update the other fields in this file.
 
- Start Fiddler
- Go to the Applications folder (e.g. C:\AderantExpert\VMHSFExpert\Applications) and load an application that has not been previously loaded. Observe Fiddler - the application will open successfully, and you should not see any calls to download files via HTTP.",

We can delete the required files to simulate this, by deleting files from the applications folder e.g. C:\AderantExpert\VMHSFExpert\Applications. E.g. for Billing, we can delete Aderant.Billing.dll.
 
- Launch Fiddler so we can monitor HTTP traffic
- Check the instance.config file in Applications folder - the downloadsURL URI attribute should be pointed to the downloads folder for your environment.

- Launch the application via Expert Launcher / EA Pro
- Check Fiddler - you should see a HTTP download line for the missing file

Test approach
 
- Launch fiddler to monitor the HTTP traffic. Ensure you have the target application pinned on the taskbar as well.
- Setup the missing file by deleting a file from the Applications (e.g. C:\AderantExpert\VMHSFExpert\Applications) folder
- Launch the application and monitor Fiddler
- You should see the file being re-downloaded in fiddler, and the application launching successfully.

189264,MSI application self-healing alongside HTTP Download changes,Ready,ExpertSuite\Infrastructure\Deployment\Server Side Deployment,2018-03-14T21:51:04.487Z,"Note: For FULL Msi's, everything's self-contained and therefore HTTPDownload has no relevance because it will never try to update. Clients are advised to reinstall FULL MSI's every time they upgrade their environment.
 
For MSI applications - there are two ways to start the application, which takes us through two different routes of finding the files needed for the .exe to start successfully.
 
 
If the application is started via PINNED ON TASK MENU (1), this will start the application from the Applications folder, which bypasses the bootstrapper and therefore will NOT update unless something's changed according to the current file manifest.
- This means if an existing file is missing or different for whatever reason, this file will be pulled through via assembly resolving
- Other scenarios, detailed below
 
If the application is started through START MENU (2), this will start the application via the bootstrapper, and pull back files via HTTPDownload (falling back to assembly resolving if this isn't possible)
 
The scenarios we know to test are:
 
Deleted files – where the local cache is corrupted, starting the application via either method will allow the user to continue to use the application
To setup: 
Go to your application folder e.g. C:\AderantExpert\VMHSFExpert\Applications, and delete a file that might be needed for your application e.g. Aderant.Time.dll
For (1) - We expect the file to be pulled across via HTTP (but this will occur after the application has started - because assembly resolving kicks in after application is started, and a required file is missing - it will be fetched then. However manual observation may be meaningless since the timing difference between this and (2) will be small)
For (2) - We expect the file to be pulled across via HTTP - which occurs before the application starts as the bootstrap logic will gather all known required fiels before starting the application
 
Out of date application manifest – this will need a hand-crafted edit to the manifest in the cache to test this mechanism?? 
To setup:
For a load balanced environment, we will need to repeat the steps for both app servers
Go to your app server IIS Downloads location e.g. C:\AderantExpert\Local\Services\Downloads, and open the ExpertshareManifest.xml inside the ExpertShareManifest.Zip
Pick a file that will always be in the application cahce e.g. Aderant.Framework.dll, and update the filehash to be different than the original value

For (1) - Nothing happens - no file transfers for the changed files occurs over HTTP - because aseembly resolver doesn't care about updating files, its only concerned with getting missing files
For (2) - We expect the file with the changed hash to be updated via HTTP - because a difference in hash has been detected. Also a new ExpertshareManifest.zip will be copied via HTTP into the applications folder
 
IIS-stop: where the IIS services are stopped (and therefore the HTTP download location is not available), expertshare will continue to work for the upgrade (check with Chuan / Stef on which services to actually test the stoppage for)
(1) This is already covered by the linked test case 188793, which deals with this scenario. 
(2) This is already covered by the linked test case 188787, which deals with this scenario.",

The steps below will provide some quick reminders of what to do, but the video should be the complete step-by-step / first stop for information.
 
Testing Approach
 
1. Physical database customization (DBEditor)
In DBEditor, having decided the table you need to customize - you'll then need to pick a data type for the new column.

Common data types are:
- integer
This needs to be short as we don't support Long Datatype for data providers. Short will generate the sql data type as int, whereas Long gets generated as Int64. 
- strings of size 1 (chars)
This is treated as a CMS Boolean by our application
If this is added, you need to change the control type to Checkbox:
- strings with specific sizes
- strings of type long 
- date
- currency
- and hours (in some use cases).
 
Remember to tick Nulls or prepopulate the new column with test data before attempting to consume the customization.
Also - ID's for new columns start from 900+ for each table. 
 
Verification: You are able to see the tables with customization in Domain Wizard, in the next step
 
2. Extend the model (Domain wizard) and build the customization (Deployment manager -> Apply Customization)
In Domain Wizard, having decided the domain you want to extend with the new property you've added to the underlying table(s) - just pick it and step through the wizard:
(sample screenshot of the domain wizard)
 
Verification: Check FCM_CUSTOMIZATION_METADATA and verify the METADATA generated matches what you've just setup in Domain Wizard
 
In Deployment Manager, go to Packages tab and click Apply Customization. 
 
Verification: Customization build completes successfully, and Customization is applied successfully.
Deeper verification if time available:
 
Customization build logs
You can look in ~Binaries\ExpertSource\Customization\[generated folder name] for the CustomizationBuild.log and ~Binaries\ExpertSource\Customization\CustomizationBuilder.log for any errors that we might've swallowed. 
 
Customization slugs in stored procedures and views
Find the Stored procedures and views that has customization slugs from the table(s) we've just customized, and verify the custom properties have been added between the customization slugs.
 
This SQL might be helpful - just change the filter value for b.name to the domain you're customizing. Sometimes you might need to dig deeper than what this SQL provides!

The steps below will provide some quick reminders of what to do, but the video from the link above should be the complete step-by-step / first stop for information.
 
Testing Approach
 
1. Physical database customization (DBEditor)
 
Create your custom column - the DATATYPE of this column needs to be the SAME as the DATATYPE of the PRIMARY KEY column we're linking to, so find out beforehand.
 
Then add the foreign key - right click on the ForeignKeys heading

 
 And drag your custom column into the Linked Columns area in DBEditor

 
In the Result field, type the target table we're linking to - if the DATATYPE has been setup correctly, the columns we can link to should be populated under the Foreign Columns section.

Worked example below

 
Verification: You are able to see the tables with customization in Domain Wizard, in the next step
 
2. Extend the model (Domain wizard) and build the customization (Deployment manager -> Apply Customization)
In Domain Wizard - progress through the initial steps - the beginning is the same as the process for when we added a custom column

Note that the relationship name is in lower case - it can be either lower case or upper case or a mix in between. Our Domain Customization is expected to handle this, and we need to test these specific cases to ensure the mechanism has not regressed.
 
Verification: Check FCM_CUSTOMIZATION_METADATA and verify the METADATA generated matches what you've just setup in Domain Wizard

The steps below will provide some quick reminders of what to do, but the video from the link above should be the complete step-by-step / first stop for information. The screenshot provides a worked example - your table may / will look different!
 
A short blurb before we get underway:
 
The setup below considers the situation where we desire a relationship where one Aderant Entity (in this case Employee) has a collection of zero to many Custom entities (in this case, an entity with pet names. So, Pets). If we desire a one-to-one relationship, the Foreign Key needs to reside on the Aderant Entity, and linked back to the target entity whether it be Aderant or Custom. See linked test case for further details.
 
The importance lies in the location of the Foreign key - our software is intelligent enough to detect the type of desired relationship via this aspect, and the things we do to verify post-apply customization goes in line with how we expect Apply Customization interprets the Foreign key placement.
  
Testing Approach
 
1. Physical database customization (DBEditor)
 
Each table is composed of:
- Columns (at least one column as the primary key)
- ResultKey - this sets a column as the primary key of the table
- Foreignkeys - at least one so we know which 
 
Table creation
Note that the ID for custom tables starts at 99000+
 
COLUMNS
We want at least:
- A column to hold data
- A column to act as the Primary Key for this table - cannot be null!!!
- A column to act as the Foreign key to another table 
 
Naming convention of adding '_' in front of column names is not needed for custom table columns.
 
RESULTKEY (Primary Key)
Again - do not check the Nulls checkbox for a column that is going to be designated as a Primary Key for the table!
Right click on ResultKeys and create a new Result key for the table. Then drag the column we've created for Primary Key purpose to the Column list field. Tick Primary to indicate the Primary Key intent.
 
As part of Primary Key designation, we also need to add a index alongside it to complete the Custom table creation.
Similar to ResultKeys - drag and drop your Primary key column, then tick the checkboxes above to indicate the nature of the index being set up.
Note that the index name must be unique in the database - so provide a unique name or else the build will fail
 
FOREIGNKEYS
 
This is the same as setting up a foreign key column (see linked test case 193418) 
Verification: You are able to see the tables with customization in Domain Wizard, in the next step
 
 
2. Extend the model (Domain wizard) and build the customization (Deployment manager -> Apply Customization)
 
In Domain Wizard - progress through the initial steps - the beginning is the same as the process for when we added a custom column
Once selected - all columns of the table must be imported
 

The domain we linked to via Foreign key is available for selection.
 
In Deployment Manager, go to Packages tab and click Apply Customization. 
 
Verification: Customization build completes successfully, and Customization is applied successfully.
 
Deeper verification if time available:
Open Design Studio and access a Form that used Employee model as part of the data e.g. 

Then switch to the Data tab, and expand the Employee model:

A short blurb before we get underway:
 
The setup below considers the situation where we desire a relationship where one Aderant Entity (in this case Client) is linked to another entity (In our case, an entity with pet names. So, Pets). If we desire a one-to-many relationship, the Foreign Key needs to reside on the Custom Entity, and linked back to the Aderant entity. See linked test case for further details.
 
The importance lies in the location of the Foreign key - our software is intelligent enough to detect the type of desired relationship via this aspect, and the things we do to verify post-apply customization goes in line with how we expect Apply Customization interprets the Foreign key placement.
 
Note that although the worked example looks at linking Aderant to a custom entity, the step is still the same for linking an Aderant entity to another Aderant entity.
 
  
Testing Approach
 
1. Physical database customization (DBEditor)
 
Setup a custom table - the instructions for this are in the linked test case 193456
Note the Datatype of the Primary key column of the custom table. The Datatype of the Foreign key column we will add to the Aderant table must match.
 
Add a custom column to the Aderant table of your choice - a worked example as been done below. Instructions for doing this are in the linked test case 193418
 

 
Verification: You are able to see the tables with customization in Domain Wizard, in the next step

At the step where the relationship is defined - remember to define a unique name for the relationship you're describing. 
The domain we linked to via Foreign key is available for selection. In our case, we've selected to link to our custom entity:
Note: The source entity in this screenshot is for another entity - the original worked example is linked to Client as the source entity.
