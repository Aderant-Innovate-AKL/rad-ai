212111,Invoice - GL details - Rounding of GL Plan Split,Ready,ExpertSuite\Financials\Accounts Payable\Invoices\Invoice Items\GL,2019-03-05T01:07:22.41Z,"GL Plans should be operating as follows :
 
- the value that is entered on the invoice / payment GL Detail screen is split based on the percentages indicated in the plan
- the split values are rounded to the number of decimal places specified for the currency in question - so
- if the invoice is being entered in USD then the splits should be rounded to 2 decimal places, if the invoice is entered in JPY the splits should be to 0 decimal places.
- the splits are then added up to ensure that they balance to the original value that was entered
- if not, then the difference ( washup ) is applied to the split with the greatest value ( i.e. not to the last line )
- important - the washup step is ONLY done if the percentages in the plan add to exactly 100%. If the plan does NOT add to 100% then NO washup is performed. If they set up their plan with 33% and 66% this does not add to 100% so no washup is done. 
- the values that are saved to the database ( ACT_TRAN_JE ) are the rounded values after any washup has been performed
- when the invoice is POSTED, these values will be converted to system currency ( if different to the entry currency ) and at this time they will have lots of decimal places, based on the applicable DRUNO / exchange rate.

Quote Dave's: 

For a Vendor Payment ( as opposed to Employee, Client or Misc ) we should first look for an Address_Uno on APM_Vendor and use that. 
If one is not present on APM_Vendor ( i.e. the uno is 0 ) then we look for the Address_Uno on the HBM_Name record for the Vendor ( i.e. where vendor.Name_Uno = name.Name_Uno ). 
If that address_Uno is also 0, then we look for the first address that we can find that is attached to the name record ( ie. from HBM_Address where address.Name_Uno = name.Name_Uno )

We are showing the same values as classic for this scenario so we are calculating the values the same way. The issue seems to be that we are looking at each of the transaction for this credit and converting each to the target currency using the druno from the transaction. Each of these values is rounded, then they are summed to give the outstanding value. This is a different result to what you would get if you add the unrounded values then round the sum to 2 decimal places. The problem is that if the outstanding value is 82.4169... ( as in the scenario above ) and you then allow them to allocate 82.42, you are allowing them to overallocate. This MAY be picked up in the fx rounding routine, but I am not sure ( would require some testing ). This has not been reported from clients at this stage, so will not change it now."

Quote Dave's: 

For a Vendor Payment ( as opposed to Employee, Client or Misc ) we should first look for an Address_Uno on APM_Vendor and use that. 
If one is not present on APM_Vendor ( i.e. the uno is 0 ) then we look for the Address_Uno on the HBM_Name record for the Vendor ( i.e. where vendor.Name_Uno = name.Name_Uno ).

133985,Accounts Payable - Invoices - Electronically acquired invoices without vendor codes are saved correctly to APT_INVOICE and APS_INVOICE_Z,Design,ExpertSuite\Financials\Accounts Payable\Invoices,2016-04-18T04:39:28.35Z,"We focus on making sure when an invalid (or none) vendor code is entered, the invoice is still saved correctly.
 
Invoices with temporary vendor codes can still be saved; when the user views the invoice on the invoice form, they will need to create a valid new vendor; see Dave's notes below:
 
Validation of temp vendor names - We do not need to run any special validation against temporary names, as these will not be used as the eventual vendor name in Expert. The process will be that if an invoice is received with a temporary vendor name, it will display in the invoice list screen with a warning indicating that it is a temporary vendor. The user ( or someone else ) will have to set up a real vendor for this invoice, which will do any validation and reconciliation of vendor names etc. The user will then select the correct vendor for the invoice, the correct vendor name will be used, and the temporary vendor name will be removed – but none of this has been done yet.
 
When we do the end-to-end testing for electronic invoices, this is part of what we need to check.
 
For the end-to-end electronic invoice save check:
- Check tables: header created in APS_INVOICE_Z and APT_INVOICE
- Check the defaulting has occured in this case where no valid vendor codes were supplied, but a temporary vendor code is supplied
- Check the GL and disb detail lines have been saved
- On the invoice form, check the temp vendor name has been flagged, and user is prompted to create a new vendor.
 
Useful SQL:

According to the following series inputs (in attached spreadsheet), we expect certain outcomes; as the API is expanded, we will need to also expand the range of inputs to ensure the right messages are coming through (or if required data is missing, we show the expected error messages)
 
Also as we develop the OCR capability, we should no longer need to push data via the API and instead run end-to-end from OCR to application.
 
Error messages should be populated to APT_MESSAGE:

There are two scenarios, assuming that a valid vendor code has been provided with the invoice:
- When AddDefaultInfo flag is turned on
- When the AddDefaultInfo flag is turned off
 
The following SQL selects all fields that are to be defaulted
The first line looks at fields that will be defaulted regardless of the AddDefaultInfo flag
The second line looks at fields that are only defaulted if the AddDefaultInfo flag is turned ON
 
select CURRENCY_CODE,BOOK, TEN99_AMT,JURISDIC_CODE,TAX_IN,APPROVED,TAX_REPORT_STAT,TRAN_UNO,SESSION,INVOICE_STATUS,BANK_UNO,SCHEDULE_NUM,PERIOD,GL_AUDIT_NUM,LATEST_DATE,LATEST_PERIOD,DRUNO,USE_OVERRIDE,ADDRESS_UNO,USE_NAME_OVERRIDE,USE_ADDRS_OVERRIDE,

from APT_INVOICE
where INVOICE_DATE > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 
Testing approach
 
We will use valid vendor codes (with different settings) and check the correct settings are defaulted...
- Similar to how we're testing vendor defaulting on the invoice form, with regards to the payment terms etc. We would expect similar calculations to happen here for the invoice defaulting
- Are there other things we need to watch out for?",

    I think we should fail that test case. It doesn't seem right to me
​[10:12 AM] Jan Lawson
    Here's what the wiki says..
​[10:12 AM] Jan Lawson
    




	
Invoices entered in Classic must be released, posted, and paid in Classic ( 29/5, DJO. They can now be both paid and cancelled in Expert )
	



​[10:13 AM] Jan Lawson
    So that suggests that the invoice items should not be in an editable state when opened in expert
​[10:14 AM] Jan Lawson
    And if its opening in a non editable state then it doesn't require a lock which currentlt prevents it being edited in classic
​[10:16 AM] Jan Lawson
    Oh for that last statement, I was referring to an unposted item. The posted item should get a lock

Quote Dave's: 

For a Vendor Payment ( as opposed to Employee, Client or Misc ) we should first look for an Address_Uno on APM_Vendor and use that. 
If one is not present on APM_Vendor ( i.e. the uno is 0 ) then we look for the Address_Uno on the HBM_Name record for the Vendor ( i.e. where vendor.Name_Uno = name.Name_Uno ). 
If that address_Uno is also 0, then we look for the first address that we can find that is attached to the name record ( ie. from HBM_Address where address.Name_Uno = name.Name_Uno )
 
Since the search hiearchy is APM_vendor > hbm_name > hbm_address, we will test this from the lowest hierachy for minimal setup required.","Step 1: Data pre reqsNote: Make sure the default addresses you set are not the first addresses so you know you're not just getting back the first address in the list-Name record is the vendor- Vendor default is the remittance addressVendor 1- Name record has multiple addresses- Name record has default address- Vendor record has different default address Vendor 2- Name record has multiple addresses- Name record has default address- Vendor record does not have default address Vendor 3- Name record has multiple addresses- Name record does not have default address- Vendor record has default addressVendor 4- Name record has multiple addresses- Name record does not have default address- Vendor record does not have default addressSELECT''[Vendor Name Addresses],v.VENDOR_ID,n.NAME,CASEWHEN v.ADDRESS_UNO = a.ADDRESS_UNO Then'Y'ELSE'N'END [Ven Addr Default],CASEWHEN n.ADDRESS_UNO = a.ADDRESS_UNO Then'Y'ELSE'N'END [Name Addr Default],a.ADDRESS1,a.ADDRESS2,a.ADDRESS3,a.ADDRESS4,a.CITY,a.STATE_CODE,a.COUNTY,a.REGION_CODE,a.COUNTRY_CODE,a.ADDRESS_CODE, a.ADDRESS_UNO,a.NAME_UNO,v.VENDOR_UNOFROM HBM_ADDRESS aJOIN HBM_NAME n ON a.NAME_UNO = n.NAME_UNOJOIN APM_VENDOR v ON n.NAME_UNO = v.NAME_UNOWHERE a.ADDRESS_UNO <> 0 --AND VENDOR_ID = 'JANA1'ORDERBY v.VENDOR_ID || Step 2: Vendor and Name have default addressCreate vendor payment- use vendor 1SELECT ''[Different Default Vendor and Name address],v.VENDOR_ID,v.VENDOR_NAME,NAME,v.ADDRESS_UNO[Vendor default address],n.ADDRESS_UNO[Name default address] FROM APM_VENDOR vJOIN HBM_NAME n ON v.NAME_UNO = n.NAME_UNOWHERE v.ADDRESS_UNO > 0AND n.ADDRESS_UNO > 0AND v.ADDRESS_UNO <> n.ADDRESS_UNO | Expected: Address set from Vendor default || Step 3: Only Name has address defaultCreate vendor payment- use vendor 2SELECT ''[Default Name address only],v.VENDOR_ID,v.VENDOR_NAME,NAME,n.ADDRESS_UNO[Name default address] FROM APM_VENDOR vJOIN HBM_NAME n ON v.NAME_UNO = n.NAME_UNOWHERE v.ADDRESS_UNO = 0AND n.ADDRESS_UNO > 0 | Expected: Address set from Name default || Step 4: Only Vendor has address defaultCreate vendor payment- use vendor 3SELECT ''[Default Vendor address only],v.VENDOR_ID,v.VENDOR_NAME,NAME,v.ADDRESS_UNO [Vendor default address]FROM APM_VENDOR vJOIN HBM_NAME n ON v.NAME_UNO = n.NAME_UNOWHERE v.ADDRESS_UNO > 0AND n.ADDRESS_UNO = 0 | Expected: Address set from Vendor default || Step 5: No defaultsCreate a vendor payment- use vendor 4 | Expected: Address set from first one found (this could be a bit random)Note: Address not set in classic"
