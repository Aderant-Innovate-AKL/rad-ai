Often a collector may need to follow up with an attorney or another member of the accounting staff regarding an alert.  It would be beneficial to be able to right click on an alert and  choose send email
 
This would launch an email dialog and set the subject to the Alert Type + Payor Type and the Body of the email should embed the note that is currently in the hover for the alert.
