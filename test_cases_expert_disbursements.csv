Additional search criterion that aren't the default set are tested in a separate test case.
 
Things to Test
 
For each criterion, enter a value and search in the application
Then validate the search result by using the same field to search against ExpertQuery.Disbursement.
 
Finally, test some arbitrary combinations of the criterion (some examples below)
 
select *
from ExpertQuery.Disbursement

where ExpertDisbInitiated = 0
and TransactionDate > '2000-01-01 17:08:36.407'
and DisbursementTypeId = 'cour'
 
 
Individual criterion test details:
 
Disb ID:
 
select *
from ExpertQuery.Disbursement
where ID > 3000

Also test via inserting multiple Id's.

select *

This outline was copied from 177902. The content from this point is largely the same, except the tables we're looking at is CDT_DISB instead of CDS_DISB_Z
 
Specifically for this test case though, we need to test that the sessions can be released / unreleased given some assumptions.
We're not testing security, nor edit list report requirements, nor disbursements / sessions created outside Expert Disbursement. Pretty much the happy path test, hence Base test + Priority 1.
 
Data checking happens here - we're going to compare with the output we've gotten from doing the same operation in classic.
 
Testing approach
 
Tables concerned: 
CDT_DISB
 
 Note that there is no equivalent scenario in classic, as disbursements must sit inside a session. Therefore we expect the same thing that happened for disbursement sessions to happen here (changing the CDT_DISB.EXPERT_DISB_STATUS value)
 
Create a disbursement in Classic, and check the logs (CTRL + SHIFT + L)
Create a disbursement inside Expert Disbursement, and check the CDT_DISB table. Compare the two entries - expect EXPERT_DISB_STATUS to be null for the classic entry. (Also ED_INITATED = null)
 
Repeat the testing approach for the following scenarios:
- Selecting single disbursement with edit status - User can release
- Selecting multiple disbursements with edit status - user can release
- Selecting multiple disbursements with released status - Users can unrelease
- Selecting multiple disbursements with mixed status - no release / unrelease option is available
 
Then release the disbursement. See what has changed in CDT_DISB - we expect EXPERT_DISB_STATUS to change to R
 
Then unrelease the disbursement. See what has changed in CDT_DISB - we expect EXPERT_DISB_STATUS to changed back to E","Step 1: Release disb <> 'CDN' type and in Edit status | Expected: Release button disabled. || Step 2: Release when edit list required | Expected: Release button enabled.

A likely scenario, hence Base test Priority 3.
 
In this situation, a user must satisfy the Edit list requirements
(note: The above was from Client Disbursements -> Dibursement setup -> Parameters)
 
Or on the employee itself:

There are equivalent in places where you can set this in WPF world (Expert Administration, Entity Manager), but the above were pretty straightforward places to set this.
 
If the requirement is met, the user CAN initiate release
 
If the requirement is not met, the user is show a dialog.
 
 
In order to satisfy the edit list report requirement in Expert, you do something... which will be known when 173426 is done.
 
Note: In classic users can unrelease sessions even if edit list is required and the session hasn't been printed (makes sense to me). We should clarify with Dave to see if this makes sense in Expert too.
 
Testing approach
 
Repeat the below approach for these scenarios:
- Edit list required set in Disbursement parameters
- Edit list required set on the user, but not in the disbursement parameters
 
 
At this point in time, we don't have the ability to go through the Edit List path. So we'll need to do some SQL magic:
 
update CDT_DISB
set EDIT_REPORT_PRINT_REF = 666
where DISB_UNO = 3467
 
You should be able to release the disbursement now.
**Remember that after SQL script is run, you'll need to re-search for the disbursement in order to be able to release, as the returned object is still at the 'old state' of having 0 as the edit list reference number
 
This will kick off a job:
 

 select DISB_UNO, EXPERT_DISB_STATUS,ED_INITIATED, EDIT_REPORT_PRINT_REF,LAST_MODIFIED
from CDT_DISB
where DISB_UNO in (1861, 3467)
 
EXPERT_DISB_STATUS should now update from E to R
 
**Note that in order to unrelease, there are no other requirements except for the disbursement to be in the ""released"" state. We don't have to test this in this test case if short on time.",Step 1: See summary for test
